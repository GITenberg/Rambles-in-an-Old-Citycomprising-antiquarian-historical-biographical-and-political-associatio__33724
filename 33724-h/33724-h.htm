<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It has been very aptly remarked by a recent writer, that
&ldquo;to send forth a work without a preface, is like thrusting
a friend into the society of a room full of strangers, without
the benefit of an introduction;&rdquo; a custom that no
<i>fashion</i> can redeem from the charge of incivility.&nbsp; A
book, however insignificant, grows beneath the author&rsquo;s
pen, to occupy a place in his regard, not unworthy the title of
friendship; and as that sacred bond of social union is not
dependent upon individual perfection, so the companion of many a
solitary hour is not to be cast out upon the &ldquo;wide, wide
world,&rdquo; without one word to secure it at least a gentle
reception, be its faults as manifold and manifest as they may,
even to the most partial eye.</p>
<p><!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>The design of this little book of &ldquo;Rambles,&rdquo;
has been to concentrate into the form of a light and amusing
volume, some few of the many subjects of interest suggested by
the leading features of an &ldquo;Old City.&rdquo;&nbsp; It makes
no pretensions to any profound learning or deep research.&nbsp;
It is little more than a <i>compilation</i> of facts, interwoven
with the history of one of the oldest cathedral and manufacturing
cities of our country; but inasmuch as the general features are
common to most other ancient cities, and many of the subjects are
national and universal in their character, the outlines are by no
means strictly local in their application or interest.</p>
<p>Whether the design has been carried out, in a way at all
worthy of the hale old city of Norwich, that has served as
&ldquo;the text of the discourse,&rdquo; remains to be proved;
but the attempt to contribute to the light literature of the day
a few simple gleanings of fact, as gathered by a stranger, during
a ten years&rsquo; residence in a &ldquo;strange land,&rdquo;
will, it is to be hoped, secure a lenient judgment for the
inexperience that has attempted the task.</p>
<p><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>The sources of information from which the historical
parts of the work have been derived, are such as are open to
every ordinary student; its light character has precluded the
introduction of notes of reference, but it would amount to
downright robbery to refrain from acknowledging the copious
extracts that have been made from the valuable papers of the
Norfolk Arch&aelig;ological Society.</p>
<p>For the kind assistance of the few individuals from whom
information has been sought, many thanks are due; and it is but
just to state, that all deficiences of matter or details, that
may probably be felt by many, more familiar than the writer
herself with the persons, places, and things, that make the sum
and substance of her work, are referable alone to the difficulty
she has experienced in selecting suitable materials to carry out
her design, from the abundance placed at her disposal; a tithe of
which might have converted her &ldquo;rambles&rdquo; into a
heavy, weary &ldquo;march,&rdquo; along which few might have had
patience to accompany her.</p>
<p>To these few observations must be subjoined an <!-- page
vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>expression of earnest and heartfelt thanks to the many
liberal-minded individuals who have extended encouragement to
this feeble effort of a perfect stranger.&nbsp; That some portion
or other of the contents of her little volume may be found worthy
their acceptance, is the fervent desire of</p>

<span class="smcap">introduction</span>.</h1>
<p>Who that has ever looked upon the strange conglomerations of
architecture that line the thoroughfares of an ancient city,
bearing trace of a touch from the hand of every age, from
centuries far remote,&mdash;or watched the busy scenes of modern
every-day life, surrounded by solemnly majestic, or quaintly grim
old witnesses of our nation&rsquo;s&rsquo; infancy,&mdash;but has
felt the Poetry of History that lies treasured up in the
chronicles of an &ldquo;Old City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may not all be arch&aelig;ologists, we may many of us feel
little sympathy with the love of accumulating time-worn,
moth-eaten relics of ages passed away, still less may we desire
to see the resuscitation of dead forms, customs or laws, which we
believe to <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>have been advances upon prior existing
institutions, living their term of natural life in the season
appointed for them, and yielding in their turn to progressions
more suited to the growing wants of a growing people; but there
are few minds wholly indifferent to the associations of time and
place, or that are not conscious of some reverence for the links
connecting the present with the past, to be found in the many
noble and stupendous works of ancient art, yet lingering amongst
us, massive evidences of lofty thoughts and grand conceptions,
which found expression in the works of men&rsquo;s hands, when
few other modes existed of embodying the imaginations of the
mind.</p>
<p>It is not now my purpose to draw comparisons between the
appeals thus made through the outward senses to the spirituality
of our nature, and the varied other and more subtle means
employed in later days, to awaken our feelings of veneration and
devotion, but it may be observed in passing, that amid the floods
of change that have swept across our country&rsquo;s history, it
is scarcely possible but that some good should have been lost
among the d&eacute;bris of decayed and shattered
institutions.&nbsp; We have now to take a sweeping glance at the
general outline of the place that has been chosen as the nucleus
from which to spin our web, of light and perhaps fanciful
associations.&nbsp; A desultory ramble through the streets <!--
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and
bye-ways of an old city, that owns six-and-thirty parish
churches, the ghosts of about twenty more defunct, the remains of
four large friaries and a nunnery, some twenty or thirty temples
of worship flourishing under the divers names and forms of
&ldquo;dissent,&rdquo; two Roman branches of the Catholic Church,
a Jewish synagogue, a hospital, museum, libraries, and
institutions of every possible name, and &ldquo;refuges&rdquo;
for blind, lame, halt, deaf, &ldquo;incurable,&rdquo; and
diseased in mind, body, or estate; that is sprinkled with
factories, bounded by crumbling ruins of old rampart walls, and
studded with broken and mutilated bastion towers,&mdash;brings
into view a series of objects so heterogeneous in order and
character, that to arrange the ideas suggested by them to the
mind or memory, is a task of no slight difficulty.</p>
<p>The great &ldquo;lions&rdquo; of interest to one, may rank the
very lowest in the scale of another&rsquo;s imagination or
fancy.&nbsp; The philosopher, the poet, the philanthropist, the
antiquarian, the utilitarian, the man of the world, and the man
of the day, each may choose his separate path, and each find for
himself food for busy thought and active investigation.</p>
<p>The arch&aelig;ologist may indulge his love of interpreting
the chiselled finger-writing of centuries gone by, upon many a
richly decorated page of sculpture, and, hand in hand with the
historian and divine, may trace out the pathway of art and
religion, through <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the multiform records of genius,
devotional enthusiasm, taste, and beneficence, chronicled in
writings of stone, by its ecclesiastical remains; he may gratify
himself to his heart&rsquo;s content with
&ldquo;vis-&agrave;-vis&rdquo; encounters with grim old faces,
grinning from ponderous old doorways, or watching as sentinels
over dark and obscure passages, leading to depths impenetrable to
outward vision, and find elaborately carved spandrils and
canopies, gracing the entrances of abodes where poverty and
labour have long since found shelter in the cast-off habitations
of ancient wealth and aristocracy.</p>
<p>He may venture to explore cavernous cellars with groined
roofings and piers that register their age; may make his way
through moth-corrupted storehouses of dust and lumber; to revel
in the grandeur of some old &ldquo;hall,&rdquo; boasting itself a
relic of the domestic architecture of the days of the last Henry,
and there lose himself in admiration of old mullioned windows,
tie-beams, and antique staircases; may ferret out old cabinets
and quaint old buffets hard by, that once, perchance, found
lodging in the &ldquo;Stranger&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; as it is
wont, though erringly, to be designated; he may wander thence
through bye lanes and streets, stretching forth their upper
stories as if to meet their opposite neighbours half way with the
embrace of friendship; over the plain, memorable as the scene of
slaughter in famous Kett&rsquo;s rebellion, <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to the
&ldquo;World&rsquo;s End;&rdquo; and see amid the tottering ruins
of half demolished pauper tenements, the richly carved king-posts
and beams of the banquet chamber of the famous knight, Sir Thomas
Erpingham, whose martial fame and religious &ldquo;heresy&rdquo;
have found a more lasting monument than the perishable frame-work
of his mansion-house, in the magnificent gateway known by his
name, and raised in commemoration of his sin of Lollardism.&nbsp;
He may accompany the philanthropist in his visit to the
&ldquo;Old Man&rsquo;s Hospital,&rdquo; and mourn over the
misappropriation of the nave and chancel of fine old St.
Helen&rsquo;s, where lies buried Kirkpatrick, a patriarch of the
tribe of antiquaries; he may visit the grammar school that has
sent forth scholars, divines, warriors, and lawyers; a Keye, a
Clarke, an Earle, <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> a Nelson, and a Rajah Brooke, to spread
its fame in the wide world.&nbsp; He may see in it a record of
the days when grammar was forbidden to be taught elsewhere; he
may peep through the oriels that look in upon the charnel-house
of the ancient dead beneath; may feast his eyes upon the beauties
of the Erpingham, and strange composite details of the Ethelbert
gateways; explore the mysteries of the Donjon, or Cow Tower; and
following the windings of the river past the low archway of the
picturesque little ferry, find himself at length stumbling upon
some fragment <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of the old
&ldquo;<i>Wall</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thence he may trace the ancient
frontier line of the Old City, and the sites of its venerable
gateways, that <i>were</i>, but <i>are not</i>; the flintwork of
the old rampart, now clinging to the precipitous sides of
&ldquo;Butter Hills,&rdquo; with an old tower at the summit,
mounted, sentinel-like, to keep watch over the ruins of the
Carrow Abbey, and the alder cars, that gave it its name in the
valley below; now, following a broken course, here and there left
in solitude for wild creepers and the rare indigenous carnation
to take root upon; now bursting through incrustations of modern
bricks and mortar, and showing a bastion tower, with its orifices
ornamented by spread-eagle emblems of the stone-mason&rsquo;s
craft in the precincts below; here, forming the back of
slaughter-houses, or the foundations of some miserable workshop,
fashioned from the rubble of its sides; thence wandering on
through purlieus of wretchedness and filth that might shake the
nerves of any more vulnerable bodies than &ldquo;paving
commissioners&rdquo; or &ldquo;boards of health;&rdquo; its
arched recesses, once so carefully defined, its elevated walks,
so studiously preserved for recreation as well as for defence,
all now rendered an indefinite disfigured mass, with accretions
of modern growth, that bear the stamp upon every feature of their
parentage, poverty and decay.&nbsp; He may visit barns and
cottages with remnants of windows and doorways, that make it <!--
page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>easy to believe they once had been the shrine of a St.
Mary Magdalen; may trace out for himself, among hovels and
cellars, and reeking court-yards, grey patches of festering ruin,
last lingering evidences of the age of conventual grandeur; here,
in the priory yard of a parish, that might be said to shelter the
offscum of poverty&rsquo;s heavings up, he shall find a little
ecclesiastical remnant of monastic architecture, converted into a
modern meeting-house; the nursery walls that cradled the genius
of a Bale, the carmelite monk, and great chronicler of his age,
now echoing the doctrines of the &ldquo;Reformed Religion,&rdquo;
as taught by the Anabaptist preacher.&nbsp; In another district,
but still skirting on the river-side, where those old monks ever
loved to pitch their dwelling-places, down in a dreary little
nook, shut out from noisy thoroughfares, and bearing about it all
the hushed stillness that beseems the place, he may seek the
ghostly companionship of the old &ldquo;friar of orders
grey&rdquo; in the lanes and walks that once bounded the
flourishing territory of the rich &ldquo;mendicant&rdquo;
followers of holy St. Francis, or &ldquo;friars minors,&rdquo; as
they were wont to call themselves.&nbsp; Not far distant, the
whereabouts of the old Austin Friars may invite attention; and
the locale of the &ldquo;Carrow Nunnery,&rdquo; or ladies&rsquo;
seminary of the medi&aelig;val times, claim a passing enquiry,
and note of admiration for the beauty of its site.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Sacred spots, consecrated by the holy waters of loving
humanity and gentle charity, in ages gone by, as the refuge of
the diseased leper and homeless poor, shall be pointed to as the
mustard-seed from whence have sprung those glorious monuments of
our land, the hospitals for the sick of these later
generations.</p>
<p>Nor would he rest content without a glimpse of the Museum and
its relics of the dead, its hieroglyphical urns and querns,
spurs, fibul&aelig;, and celts, its pyxes and beads, its lamps
and coins, that lead imagination back to pay domiciliary visits
to the wooden huts, earthen fortifications, and sepulchral
hearths of our Icenic, Roman, or Saxon forefathers, while gaping
Egyptian mummies stand by, peering from their wizened-up
eye-balls at the industrious student of the &ldquo;gallery of
antiquities,&rdquo; looking wonder at the preference displayed
for them, over the more brilliant attractions offered to the
lover of natural history, and ornithology in particular, among
the collections below.</p>
<p>Nor shall the antiquarian be alone in his enjoyment.&nbsp; The
botanist shall delight to enrich his herbarium from the same
hedgerows, fir-woods, cornfields and rivulets, that have yielded
flowers, mosses, hepatica, and alg&aelig; to the researches of a
Smith, a Hooker, and a Lindley, the children of science nurtured
on its soil.&nbsp; The lover of music shall find <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>fresh beauties
in the harmonies of its organs, quires, and choruses, from the
halo of associations cast around them by the memories of a
Crotch, the remembrance of the Gresham professorship, filled from
the musical ranks of the city, and may be, in time to come from a
new lustre added by another name, that has begun to be sounded
forth by the trumpet of fame in the musical world.</p>
<p>The scholar and literary man shall acknowledge the interest
claimed by the nursery in which has been reared a Bale, a Clarke,
a Parker, a Taylor, a Gurney, an Opie, and a Borrow, and we may
add, a Barwell and a Geldart, whose fruit and flowers, scattered
on the way-side of the roads of learning, have made many a rough
path smooth to young and tender feet.</p>
<p>The philanthropist shall dwell upon the early lessons of
Christian love and humanity breathed into the heart of a Fry from
its prison-houses, and the silent teachings of the quiet
meeting-house, where the brethren and sisters, in simple garb of
sober gray, are wont to assemble, and where yet may still be seen
the adopted sister Opie, resting in the autumn of her days in the
calm seclusion of the body of Friends, after a life spent in
scattering abroad in the world, germs of simple truth, pure
morality, and heart-religion, the fruits of the genius which has
been her gift from God.&nbsp; He shall visit Earlham <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Hall,
the birthplace of that great &ldquo;sister of charity,&rdquo;
Elizabeth Fry, and her brother, the philanthropist, Joseph John
Gurney, and beneath its avenues of chestnut, by the quiet waters
of its little lake, and the banks of bright anemones, that lay
spread like a rich carpet, in the early spring time, along its
garden borders, inhale sweet odours, and drink in refreshing
draughts of pure unsullied poetry, fresh from the fount of
<i>nature</i>, and fragrant with the love that breathes through
all her teachings, the first child of the Great Parent of
good.</p>
<p>Hence he may trace his way back through the village hamlet,
that gave a home in his last years to the weary-hearted Hall,
yielding a refuge and a grave to the head bowed beneath the
weight of a sorrow-burthened mitre; and with hearts yet vibrating
to the mournful cadences of woe, that swept from his harp
strings, forth upon the world from its saddened solitudes, they
may pass on to the garden of the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace, and the
monuments yet lingering there; ivy-clad ruins, meet emblems of
harsh realities, over which the hand of time has thrown the
sheltering mantle of forgiveness.&nbsp; And among the many chords
touched by the hand of memory here, where the shades of harsh
bigotry and persecuting zeal vanish in the gentle and softened
light of Christian charity, breathed forth by the spirits of
later days, whose heart does not respond <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to the
refined poetry of the Charlotte Elizabeth, who has given such
sweet paintings of this familiar scene of her girlhood&rsquo;s
years?&nbsp; Who can forget the song of the Swedish Nightingale,
as it thrilled through the evening air upon the listening ears of
the ravished, though untutored multitude? happy associations of
the enjoyments of working world life, and lay minstrels of
God&rsquo;s creation, to be blended with the grander, but scarce
more solemn, memories of the great heads among the labourers in
the harvest field of souls.&nbsp; Nor shall the poet forget to
take a glimpse of the quiet home, not far distant hence, of
Sayer, the poet, philanthropist, philosopher, and antiquarian,
whose memory is still green in the hearts of many of the great
and good still living, and the remembrance of whose friendship is
esteemed by them among their choicest treasures.</p>
<p>The historian has a yet wider field for labour, and a busier
work to do, to connect into one chain the links that lie
scattered far and wide, among deserted thoroughfares, decaying
mansion houses, desecrated churches, and monastic ruins; to
gather up the broken fragments of political records, enshrined in
many a mouldering parchment, crumbling stone, or withered tree;
and to weave into a whole the threads of tradition and legendary
lore, unravelled from the mystic fables of antiquity.&nbsp; It is
his, to trace the identities of King Gurgunt and the Danish
Lothbroc; <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>to establish the founder of the
castle, and commemorate the achievements of its feudal lords;
upon him the duty of sifting evidence, and searching out causes,
of tracing the famous &ldquo;Kett&rsquo;s rebellion,&rdquo; to
the deep-seated sense of wrong in the hearts of the people, that
found expression in the vague predictions and mystical prophecies
of the Merlin of the district.</p>
<p>It is for him to unfold the little germs of after-history,
that he treasured up in the kernels of such documents as he order
addressed to the county sheriff, to commit to prison those who
refused to attend the services of the established church; to
trace the growth of the spirit among the people, that opened the
city gates to the army of the &ldquo;Parliament,&rdquo; fortified
its castle against royalist soldiers, and turned its market-place
into a place of execution for fellow-citizens, who dared to
espouse the cause of their king; to rescue from oblivion the gems
that were buried beneath the blows of the zealous puritan&rsquo;s
demolishing hammer; to read in the nailed horseshoes, that
surmount the doorways of hundreds of its cottages, as a talisman
against witchcraft, the legacy of superstition bequeathed to
their descendants by these earnest &ldquo;abolitionists;&rdquo;
to mark the <i>rise</i> and <i>progress</i> of the unfranchised
masses in this age of enlightened liberalism, and the deepening
and mellowed tone of the &ldquo;voice of the people,&rdquo; as it
rises from the <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>chastened and self-disciplined homes
of the educated and thriving artisans.&nbsp; Upon him too, it
devolves, to mark the age and the man&mdash;to see the monuments
of the great-hearted and liberal-minded of the days gone by, in
the hospitals, charities, and endowments, their munificence has
showered down, from the heights of prosperity, upon the depths of
poverty&mdash;to trace the progress of the philanthropist of
later times, in his house to house visits, and read statistics of
his labours in the renovated homes and gladdened hearts of
thousands, thus lifted out from the swamps of misery and crime,
by the single hand of Christian benevolence, stretched forth in
sympathy; to mark the efforts of legislation to remove causes
that evil results may cease, to note the patriotism of honest
hearts, that would seek to level, if at all, by lifting up the
poor to that standard of moral and physical comfort, beneath
which the manhood of human nature has neither liberty nor room to
grow; and finally, it is his to cast into the treasury of his
nation&rsquo;s history his gleanings among the bye-ways of a
single city, no mean or despicable bundle of facts, with which to
enrich its stores.</p>
<p>But we must tarry no longer to generalize with
arch&aelig;ologist, poet or historian; we have many storehouses
to visit, where associations of religion, poetry, and art, lie
garnered up in rich abundance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a city?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A city contains a
cathedral, or Bishop&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such being the definition given us in one of those valuable
literary productions that we were wont in olden time to call
Pinnock&rsquo;s ninepennies, and which have since been followed
by dozens upon dozens of series upon series, written by a host of
good souls that have followed in his wake, devoting <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>themselves to the task of retailing homeopathic doses of
concentrated geography, biography, philosophy, astronomy,
geology, and all the other phies, nies, onomies, and ologies,
that ever perplexed or enlightened the brains of the rising
generation; we adopt the term, in memory of those so-called happy
days of childhood, when its vague mysticism suggested to our
country born and school-bred pates a wide field of speculation
for fancy to wander in; a Cathedral and a Bishop&rsquo;s see
being to us, in their unexplained nomenclature, figures of speech
as hieroglyphical as any inscription that ever puzzled a Belzoni
or a Caviglia to decipher.</p>
<p>We have grown, however, to know something of the meaning of
these terms; and having lived to see a few specimens of real
cathedrals and live bishops, we are now quite ready to
acknowledge the priority of their claims upon our notice when
rambling among the lions of an old city.</p>
<p>We say old, but where is the cathedral not old? save and
except a few just springing into existence, evidences we would
hope of a reaction in the devotional tendencies of our nature,
rising up once more through the confused assemblage of churches
and chapels, and meeting houses, reared in honour of man&rsquo;s
intellect, sectarian <i>isms</i>; human deity in fact, with its
standard <i>freedom of thought</i>, under which the myriad
diverse forms of hero worshippers <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>have rallied
themselves, each with their own atom of the broken statue of
truth, that they may vainly strive <i>of their own power</i> to
re-unite again into a perfect and harmonious whole.&nbsp; Setting
aside, however, these later efforts to regain something of the
lofty conceptions that can alone enter into the mind of a
worshipper of God, not man, we have to deal with the monuments of
a past age yet left among us, witnessing to the early life in the
church, though not unmingled with symptoms of disease, and marks
of the progress of decay,&mdash;marks which are indeed fearfully
manifest in the relics existing in our country, that bear almost
equal traces of corruption and spiritual growth, each struggling,
as it were, for victory.&nbsp; Is there any one who can walk
through the lofty nave of a cathedral, and not feel <i>lifted
up</i> to something? may be he knows not <i>what</i>; but the
spirit of worship, of adoration, is breathed on him as it were
from the structure around him.&nbsp; And should it not be so?
does not the blue vault of heaven, with its unfathomed ocean of
suns and worlds, each moving in its own orbit, obeying one common
law of order and perfect harmony, call up our reverence for the
God of <i>Nature</i>? and has it ever been forbidden that the
heart and understanding should be appealed to through the medium
of the outward senses, for the worship of the God of
<i>Revelation</i>?&nbsp; Is the eye to be closed, the mouth dumb,
the ear deaf, to all save <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the
intellectual teachings of a fellow man?&nbsp; Is <i>music</i> the
gift of heaven, <i>colour</i> born in heaven&rsquo;s light,
<i>incense</i> the fragrance of the garden, planted by
God&rsquo;s hand, <i>form</i> the clothing of soul and spirit, to
be banished from the temple dedicated to the service of that
living God, who created the music of the bird, the waterfall, and
the thunder, who painted the rainbow in the window of heaven, who
scented the earth with sweet flowers, and herbs and &ldquo;spicy
groves,&rdquo; who gave to each tree, each leaf, each bird and
flower, each fibre, sinew, and muscle of the human frame, each
crystal, and each gem of earth, each shell of the ocean&rsquo;s
depths, each moss and weed that creeps around the base of hidden
rocks, even to the noisome fungus and worm that owes its birth
alike to death and to decay a material body, full of beauty and
adaptation in all its parts; revealing thus to man, that all
thought, all life, all spirit, must dwell within an outer
covering of <i>form</i>.&nbsp; True, the spirit and life may
depart, the garment may cover rottenness and decay, the symbol
may be a dead letter, in the absence of the truth it should
shadow forth, the candle at the altar, be meaningless from the
dimness of the light of the spirit, that it should represent as
ever living and present in the church; the eagle of the
reading-desk be a graven image, without place in God&rsquo;s
temple, when the soaring voice of prophecy, rising above earth,
and fed from <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the living fire burning on
heaven&rsquo;s altar, that it should symbolize, has ceased to be
heard.&nbsp; Incense may be a mystic mockery, when the prayers of
the children of God have ceased to ascend in unison as a sweet
smelling savour to the throne of their Father; the swelling chant
be monotonous jargon, when the beauty and harmony of <i>one
common voice</i> of praise, thanksgiving, and prayer, is not
felt; the vestment be a mere display of weak and empty vanity,
when purity, activity, authority and love, have ceased to be the
realities expressed in the alb, the stole, the crimson and
purple, the gold and silver; the screen, a senseless mass of
carving, the long unbenched and empty nave, so much waste stone
and mortar, to those who see not in it the vast Gentile court,
where the voice of preaching and invitation was sent forth to
sinners to enter the temple and join in the <i>worship</i> of
<i>praise</i> and <i>prayer</i> of the <i>church within</i>.</p>
<p>Why are all these too often as cold and empty outlines of a
nothing to our senses? is it not that their life is gone?&nbsp;
But should we therefore cast away the fragments that remain?
should we not rather desire that the spirit may breathe upon the
dry bones, that they may live again, and form a new and living
temple for the most High to dwell in; the outer edifice of wood
and stone, being the <i>model</i> or <i>statue</i> of that
spiritual church, of which every pillar, every window, every
beam, and curtain, <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>should be formed of living members,
with Christ for the foundation and chief corner stone, to be
built up and fashioned by the hand of God; every sand or ash of
truth that lies scattered over the surface of the earthy being
cemented together by bonds of love and charity, to form the
masonry of the one great Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Such thoughts may be misunderstood, and bring down upon us, in
these days of Papal Aggression, anathemas from many a zealous
reformationist, or member of the heterogeneous Protestant
Alliance, nay, perhaps every shade of Protestant dissenter,
evangelical churchman, and Puseyite, may shake his head at us in
pity, and wonder what we mean; we would say to the last, beware
of the <i>shadow</i> without the <i>substance</i>, the
<i>symbol</i> without the <i>truth</i>, the <i>emblem</i> without
the <i>reality</i>; and of the others we would ask
forbearance.&nbsp; Popery does not necessarily lurk beneath the
advocacy of <i>forms</i>.</p>
<p>With such formidable prejudices as we may possibly have raised
by these suggestive hints, dare we hope to find companions in our
visit to the venerable pile of building, whose spire still rears
itself from the valley, where some eight hundred years ago, the
foundations were laid of one of those huge monastic institutions,
combining secular with spiritual power, once so common, and
plentifully scattered over our country, and even then grown into
strange jumbling <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>masses of error and truth, beauty and
deformity? the sole trace of whose grandeur is now to be found in
the church and cloister of a Protestant cathedral, and the palace
of a Protestant bishop.</p>
<p>We must not, however, lose sight of the fact, that this
edifice, in common with most others, among which we have to seek
the past history of the church either at home or abroad, did not
spring into existence until almost every truth possessed by the
early Christians was so hidden by cumbrous masses of
superstition, the growth of centuries of darkness, that it is
difficult, nay, almost impossible, to trace any harmony of
purpose in their outline or filling up; hence the inconsistencies
that have sprung from the efforts to revive the ornaments and
usages of a period when, the life having departed from them in a
great measure, their meaning had been lost, and their practice
perverted; hence, too, the folly often displayed by zealous
ecclesiastical symbolists, in regarding every monkey, dog,
mermaid, or imp that the carvers of wood and stone fashioned from
their own barbarous conceits, or copied from the illuminations
that some old monk&rsquo;s overheated brain had devised for
embellishment to some fanciful legend, as embodied ideas, to be
interpreted into moral lessons or spiritual sermons.</p>
<p>Before, however, we enter into the detail of the remnants left
us for examination, we may take a <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>glance over
the page of the early history of the church, and trace a little
of the origin of those errors which had grown around simple
truths, converting them from beautiful realities into monstrous
absurdities.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s reflection may suffice to enable us to
believe that the church, as planted by its first head and master,
was a <i>seed</i> to be watered and nurtured by the apostles,
prophets, and ministers appointed to the work, and intended to
have an outward growth of form, as well as inward growth of
spirituality.&nbsp; During the early period of its existence,
while suffering from the persecution of the Roman emperors, it
was impossible that the church could develop itself freely;
consequently, we are not surprised to find that &ldquo;upper
chambers,&rdquo; and afterwards the tombs and sepulchres of their
&ldquo;brethren in the faith,&rdquo; perhaps, too, of their risen
Lord, were the places of meeting of its members.&nbsp; Nor is it
difficult to trace from this origin the later superstitious
worship at the shrines of the saints.</p>
<p>As early, however, as the peaceful interval under Valerian and
Diocletian, when there was rest from persecution, houses were
built and exclusively devoted to worship; they were called
<i>houses of prayer</i>, and <i>houses of the
congregation</i>.&nbsp; And the idea that the Christian church
should only be a nobler copy of the Jewish temple was then
clearly recognized, <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the outline being as nearly as
possible preserved, and the inner part of the church, where the
table of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper stood, ever having been
inaccessible to the common people; an idea that has in a certain
sort of way survived all the reformations, dissolutions, and
dissensions of sixteen hundred years; for do we not even yet see
the minister and <i>deacons</i> of the most ultra-dissenting
meeting-houses appropriating to themselves the <i>table
pew</i>?&nbsp; There has always seemed something incongruous in
the idea, that the minute instructions which God himself thought
it worthy to deliver unto Moses in the mount, for the
construction of a &ldquo;tabernacle for the congregation,&rdquo;
and to contain the ark of the covenant, which also formed a model
for the gorgeous temple of Solomon, should be doomed to entire
annihilation at any period of the world&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>As Jewish sacrifices, laws, and covenants, were types,
pictures, of the embodiments to be found in the Christian
dispensation, when the anti-type had appeared, surely it is
possible that the tabernacle too was a type of a real building of
living stones, then to be formed and fitly framed together, and
which might have its outward symbol in the edifices of worship in
all ages.&nbsp; We may not pause to dwell upon this idea, further
than it was recognized by the early Christians, of which clear
proof exists.</p>
<p>For the nearest approach to a perfect development <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of
it, we must look to a later date, when Christianity was first
adopted by Constantine, and just prior to its alliance with the
state; and although, from the lack of authority in church
government, errors had already crept in, and mingled with many of
the practices, we believe the modern copyist might find a far
more pure and perfect model there, than in the meaningless
observances and ornaments of the middle ages.</p>
<p>Churches had then grown large and magnificent; they were
divided into three parts, the porch, the nave, and the
sanctuary.&nbsp; In the nave stood the pulpit&mdash;preaching at
that time being considered the invitation, or preparation for the
<i>church</i>, whose duty was <i>worship</i>.&nbsp; It was
divided from the sanctuary by a <i>lattice work</i>, or screen,
behind which was often a veil before the holy table, which
answered to the Holy of Holies of the temple, and within it none
but the priests entered.&nbsp; The baptistery was usually
situated without the church doors, and contained a fount, and a
reservoir for washing the hands was always to be found in the
outer court that enclosed all the buildings.&nbsp; Some writers
have traced this to heathen observances; if so, it without doubt
<i>originated</i> in the Jewish practice.&nbsp; The service
within the church was conducted with all the means at command for
rendering it complete.&nbsp; Music was
cultivated&mdash;antiphonal singing, or singing in responses,
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>practised.&nbsp; The clergy wore vestments symbolical of
their offices, each form and colour having its significant
meaning.&nbsp; Candles were burning continually at the altar, as
in the holy place of the temple, symbolising God&rsquo;s presence
in the church.&nbsp; Every part of the building was designed to
form a proportionate whole, and the principle of dedicating to
the house of God the best works of men&rsquo;s hands was
admitted, the embellishment of His temple being then deemed of
superior importance to the decoration of individual
dwelling-houses.</p>
<p>Transubstantiation had not polluted the table of the Lord by
its presence; the <i>mystery</i> of the <i>spiritual</i> presence
of the Lord in the Eucharist, appealing to <i>faith</i>, had not
been replaced by the <i>miracle</i>, directed to the carnal
senses.&nbsp; Images had no place in the house of God, picture
worship was unknown.&nbsp; Confession of sins was practised, and
penances were imposed, as tests of the sincerity of repentance;
at the celebration of the Eucharist offerings were presented, in
memory of the dead who in their lives had offered gifts to God;
fasting was observed, but only from choice, and Sunday and the
feast of Pentecost were the only <i>festivals</i> and holy-days
observed.&nbsp; Gradually, however, after the alliance of the
church with the state, and through the accession of converts from
the heathen world, grosser elements mingled themselves with these
observances; the superstition that the <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>spirits of
the saints hovered around the mortal remains they had tenanted,
led to the removal of their bodies from their tombs, and placing
them within the walls of the church, and to the erection of
shrines, where, first to offer up worship <i>with</i> them,
afterwards <i>to</i> them.</p>
<p>And who among us cannot feel the poetry and truth that gave
birth to this superstition?&nbsp; Who that has ever watched in
the chamber of death the bursting of the earthly chrysalis, has
not felt the soft touch of the spirit&rsquo;s wing, has not been
conscious of the presence of the spiritualized immortal, has not
recognized the fragrance of the soul passing from its earthly
habitation, and filling the air with the essence of its life, as
the sweet scent of the flower when its perfect fruition has been
accomplished, lingers around the leaves of the falling
petals?</p>
<p>Who that has ever witnessed the laying down of life in ripened
age, by some great and noble type of our humanity, in whose heart
the lion and the lamb, the eagle and the dove have dwelt
together, but has seemed to breathe an atmosphere laden with
power and love, strength, beauty and gentleness, as the spirit
passed forth at the call of Him who gave it birth?&nbsp; And who
has ever seen the portals of the spirit world open before them,
for one in whom all earthly trust, and confidence, and love were
centred, but has felt that an angel guardian lived for them in
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Heaven?&nbsp; Is there no plea for saint worship?&nbsp;
But, alas! the poetry and the truth of the superstition became
clouded, and were lost in the dark mists of ignorance and
worldliness, and from their decay sprung up, like a fungus plant,
the noxious idea of the efficacy of reliques, with the monstrous
absurdities that accompanied their presence.&nbsp; Confession and
penance merged into the sale of indulgences, purchased
absolutions, and interdicts; the sleep of the dead, into a belief
in purgatorial fires, voluntary seclusion from the gaieties and
follies of the world, into forced separation from its active
duties; saint worship, image worship, and picture worship
gradually usurped the place of the worship of the one God; the
cross, from a symbol grew into an idol, and emblems, vestments,
and incense, losing their character, from the reality departing,
whose presence they should only shadow forth, grew into mere
accumulations of ceremonial, covering a decayed skeleton.&nbsp;
In this process it is easy to trace the influence of Pagan
superstition.&nbsp; As the heathen world gradually became
converted to Christianity, objects in the new faith were sought
out, around which to cluster the observances and rites of the old
system.&nbsp; Thus the worship offered to Cybele, the great
mother of the gods, who among the innumerable deities of ancient
Rome was pre-eminent, was readily transferred to the madonna,
from a fancied resemblance, and as <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Juno,
Minerva, Vesta, Pan, and others, were the especial guardians of
women, olive trees, bakers, shepherds, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; So
Erasmus, Teodoro, Genaro, and other saints received homage as the
peculiar patrons of individuals or classes.&nbsp; The Genii,
Lares, and Penates, occupying the Larrarium of the ancient
houses, were replaced, or oftener rebaptized under the names of a
madonna, saints or martyrs; the Emperor Alexander, the son of
Mammaea, actually placed the image of Christ in his Larrarium,
with his Lares and Penates.&nbsp; The <i>Sacrarium</i> took its
origin hence.&nbsp; The Pagan had been accustomed to bring his
<i>hostia</i> as a <i>sacrifice</i> to Jove; the convert found
opportunity to engraft the idea on the commemorative service of
the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Meantime church government had been going on in a floundering
sort of way, groping about in the dark for authority on which to
act, but having lost the apostleship and prophets, set in the
church to rule and guide it, and to aid in the work of perfecting
the saints, the pastors or bishops set about establishing a
system to replace that given them from above&mdash;thence began
divisions, schisms, and heresies without number, and as early as
the commencement of the third century, we find the bishops
holding synods as a means towards obtaining Catholic form of
doctrine; gradually the bishops in whose provinces these synods
were held, who were called metropolitans, <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>took
precedence in rank to others, and thus those of Rome, Antioch,
and Alexandria, came to be recognised as the heads or
chiefs.&nbsp; After the removal of the seat of empire by
Constantine, this principle extended itself in the western church
at Rome, until the final assumption of temporal and spiritual
power over all Christendom by Hildebrand, or Gregory VII., who,
although not the first that bore the title of Pope, was the first
who thoroughly established the power of the Papacy.</p>
<p>Another important feature of Christianity during these ages,
was the progress of monasticism, which had steadily increased
from the time of Anthony the Hermit, who fleeing from the
corruptions and vanities of the world, had sought to prove and
improve his sanctity, by retirement to a solitary cell, there to
practise all manner of self tortures; in this laudable attempt he
was followed by a host of others, each vying with his brother, as
to which could attain the highest perfection in extravagant
folly.&nbsp; Thus one lived on the top of a pillar, and was
emulated by a whole tribe of pillar saints; another punished
himself for killing a gnat, by taking up his abode in marshes
where flies abounded, whose sting was sufficient to pierce the
hide of a boar, and whose operations upon his person were such as
to disfigure him so that his dearest friends could not recognise
him; another class, the ascetics, carried on <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>their rigid
system of self-denial in the midst of society, others wandered
about as beggars, and were afterwards called mendicants, or
wandering friars; but the anchorets, or <i>pillar saints</i>,
attained the ultimatum of glory, in their elevation of sanctity
on the top of their pillars.&nbsp; In progress of time these
hermits began to associate themselves into fraternities; and as
far back as the middle of the second century, we hear of a body
of seventy, establishing themselves in the deserts of Nitria, by
the Nitron lakes.&nbsp; It is told of St. Macarius, the head of
this body, that having received a bunch of grapes, he sent it to
another, who tasting one, passed it to another; he being like
abstemious, sent it again forward to another, until, having gone
the circuit, it reached Macarius again unfinished.</p>
<p>Basil the Great first founded a permanent monastic
establishment to convert people from the error of Arianism; and
Benedict, a native of Mursia in Umbria, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 529, first established a regular order
among the scattered convents, by uniting them under a fixed
circle of laws, seclusion for life being the primary one.&nbsp;
These societies also were made useful by him, in having allotted
to them various occupations, such as the education of the young,
copying and preserving manuscripts, recording the history of
their own times in their chronicles, and also in the manual
labour of cultivating waste lands.&nbsp; At first <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the
monks had been reckoned among the laity, the convents forming
separate churches, of which the abbot was usually presbyter,
standing in the same relation to the bishop as in other churches;
but monastic life gradually came to be considered the preparation
for the clerical office, especially that of bishop.&nbsp; This
led to the adoption of monastic discipline among the clergy; and
the law of celibacy which had been rejected at the council of
Nice, was then prescribed by Siricius, bishop of Rome.</p>
<p>The convents were the representatives of the Christian
aristocracy or monarchy, the mendicant orders, were the clergy of
the poor.&nbsp; And each in their sphere exercised a great
civilizing influence on the people; the latter especially,
because the former, by their studies and literary labours, were
more occupied in preparing the revival of letters, and the
diffusion of knowledge in their own circle.&nbsp; Under the
auspices of the church, systems of Christian charity were
established, schools for children, hospitals and homes of refuge,
were multiplied; all this was beneficial, it was the warmth of
Christian light shining in dark places, although deep and painful
wounds existed, whose fatal consequences soon became
manifest.</p>
<p>Such was the state of the church when St. Augustine laid claim
to the supremacy of this country, towards the end of the sixth
century.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>This zealous missionary, according to Neander, would
seem to have been especially wanting in the Christian grace of
humility, which no doubt was the cause of the disputes between
the early British church and the Romish Anglo-Saxon that ensued,
which, however, were settled by Oswys, king and afterwards saint
of Northumberland, who decided upon acknowledging the Romish
supremacy, and from that time the doctrines, ritual, Gregorian
chaunt and Latin service of the Romish church were adopted, and
an admirable old man, Theodore of Cilicia, who brought sciences
with him from Greece, occupied the see of Canterbury, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 668&ndash;690.&nbsp; The thirst for
knowledge among the people at this time was ministered to by this
good old man, who, with his friend Abbot Hadrian, made a progress
through all England, seeking to gather scholars around him; and
the instructions thus communicated to the English church were
soon after collected by Bede, that simple and thoughtful, as well
as inquiring and scientific priest and monk, who says of himself,
&ldquo;I have used all diligence in the study of the Holy
Scriptures, and in the observance of conventual rules, and the
daily singing in the church; it was ever my joy either to learn,
or teach, or write something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of the western church becomes merged henceforth in
the papal power, and we pass on to the era of Hildebrand, or
Gregory VII., its great <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>representative.&nbsp; The struggles
of this prelate to suppress simony, and enforce the celibacy of
the clergy, are among the most notorious features of his reign;
legates were despatched to all the provinces of the west, over
which he had already set up claim to supreme power, stirring up
the people against the married clergy; and in order at once to
strike at the root of simony, he forbade entirely the investiture
of ecclesiastics by civil authorities.&nbsp; He excommunicated
five councillors of Henry IV. of Germany, threatened Philip of
France with the same punishment, and would doubtless have carried
out his plans with equal rigour in England, but for the potency
of the monarch with whom he had to deal.&nbsp; William the
Conqueror refused permission for the bishops to leave the country
when summoned to Rome, exercised his right of investiture, and
treated the demands of the Pope with cold indifference.&nbsp; Yet
Gregory took no further steps against so vigorous an
opponent.&nbsp; After the death of both, the contest on the right
of investiture was revived, and in the reign of Rufus was
maintained against him by Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>We have dwelt perhaps tediously on this period of history, but
its connection with our subject will be apparent, when we come to
the foundation of the cathedral we are visiting; but we must not
altogether omit mention of the most conspicuous feature <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of
political activity and religious zeal combined, that
characterized that age.&nbsp; The Crusades will eternally remain
in history an example of the devotion and mighty efforts of which
men are capable, when united by a common faith and religious
ideas.&nbsp; Gregory was the first who conceived the project,
realized afterwards by Urban II., through the instrumentality of
that wonderful man, Peter the Hermit, who went through all Europe
fanning into a flame the indignation that had been kindled by the
reports of the ill treatment of pilgrims to Palestine; and it was
not long before a countless host, urged on as much perhaps by
love of adventure, a desire to escape from feudal tyranny and
hope of gain, as religious enthusiasm, gathered round the banner
raised in Christendom.&nbsp; The object in view was not gained,
but the consequences were numerous and beneficial.&nbsp; Nations
learnt to know each other, hostilities were softened by uniting
in a common cause of Christian faith; literature in the west
received a stimulus from the contact into which it was brought
with the more enlightened eastern nations, and the poetry and
imagery of the sunnier climes threw their mantle of refinement
over the barbarisms of the colder countries.&nbsp; Among the
writings that bear this date, is the celebrated controversy
between Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1089, with Berengen,
Archdeacon of Angers, on the doctrine of Transubstantiation, a
doctrine <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>first promulgated by Paschasius
Radbertus, and at that time supported by Lanfranc, and opposed by
Berengen.</p>
<p>A proof of the partial failure, at least in this country, of
the legislations of Gregory, is found in the history of the
founder of the Norwich Cathedral.&nbsp; Gregory died <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1085, and Herbert of Losinga, Abbot of
Ramshay, Bishop of Thetford, and afterwards Bishop of Norwich, to
which city he removed the see from Thetford, laid the first stone
of the present cathedral, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1096.&nbsp; Much has been said and written as to the birth-place
of this prelate: it has usually been considered that he was a
Norman, brought over by William Rufus in 1087, but it is much
more probable that he was a native of Suffolk, and his return
with Rufus is readily accounted for by the custom existing at
that time of sending youths to France, especially Normandy, to
complete their education.&nbsp; That he purchased the see of
Thetford is undisputed, and also the abbey of Winchester for his
father, who, although a married man, filled a clerical
office.&nbsp; Remorse for these simoniacal transactions is said
to have quickly followed, and we are told that the bishop
hastened to Rome to obtain absolution, and then and there had
imposed on him the penance of building a monastery, cathedral,
and some half-dozen other large churches.&nbsp; This incredible
legend is much more reasonably explained by <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>reference to
the disturbed state of the affairs of the church before referred
to, which most probably rendered it difficult for Herbert to
obtain the spiritual rights of the see, although possessed of its
temporalities, therefore his visit to Rome; and as for the rest
of the churches attributed to him as works of penance, some other
explanation of their origin must be found.&nbsp; The coffers of
the wealthiest monarch in Europe could not have furnished means
to fulfil such a penance; and when the purchase-money of the see,
&pound;1900, and &pound;1000 for the Abbacy of Winchester, the
expenses of the journey to Rome, and the cost of his work in the
cathedral be considered, we may fairly doubt even the wealthy
Herbert&rsquo;s resources proving sufficient to meet the further
demands of such splendid edifices.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that while at Rome arrangements were
completed for the transfer of the see, but most probably only in
accordance with a previous determination of the Council of
London, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1075, when it had been
decreed that all bishoprics should be removed from villages to
the chief town of the county.&nbsp; Historians have bestowed upon
this bishop the title of the &ldquo;Kyndling Match of
Simony,&rdquo; but the sin was far too common in that age for him
to deserve so distinctive an appellation; and chroniclers, quite
as veritable and much more charitable, have given sketches of his
character, that prove him <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>to have been
an amiable, accomplished, and pious man, of great refinement, and
possessing a remarkable love of the young, and a cheerfulness and
playfulness of manner in intercourse with them, that rarely is an
attribute of any but a benevolent mind.&nbsp; We must not,
however, linger upon the personal history of the founder.&nbsp;
Associated with him in the ceremony of laying the foundation, we
find the name of the great feudal lord of the castle, Roger
Bigod, and most of the nobility and barons of the district, one
of whom, Herbert de Rye, was a devot&eacute; from the Holy
Land.&nbsp; The first stone was laid by Herbert, the second by De
Rye, the other barons placing their several stones, and
contributing in money to the work.&nbsp; The church, as left by
Herbert, consisted of the whole choir, the lower part of which,
now remaining, is the original building, though much concealed by
modern screenwork; the roofs and upper part are of later
date.&nbsp; Eborard, the successor of Herbert, built the nave,
not then raised to the present height, but terminating at the
line distinctly traceable below the clerestory windows.&nbsp; The
Catholic cathedral, or Catholic architecture, so miscalled
<i>Gothic</i>, is the pride and glory of the middle ages.&nbsp;
The spirit of the times, of fervent aspiration towards heaven,
speaks in it more, perhaps, than in the purer models of more
ancient works.&nbsp; Architecture was then the language through
which thoughts <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>found expression, speaking to the
eye, the mind, the heart, and imagination.&nbsp; Kings, clergy,
nobility, people, all contributed towards these structures.&nbsp;
Painting, sculpture, music, found a place in them, and flourished
under the auspices of religion.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Anglo-Norman
cathedrals were perhaps as much distinguished,&rdquo; says
Hallam, &ldquo;above other works of man, as the more splendid
edifices of later date;&rdquo; and they have their peculiar
effect, although perhaps not rivalling those of Westminster,
Wells, Lincoln, or York.</p>
<p>We shall not attempt to expound the details of the building;
but even the uninitiated may discern at a glance that it is a
work to which many a different age has lent its aid.&nbsp; The
simplicity of the Anglo-Norman style is blended with various
specimens of later date, not inharmoniously.&nbsp; The nave, with
its beautifully grained and vaulted roof, and elaborately
sculptured bosses, like forest boughs, and pendant roots, with
tales of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and hosts of other old Scripture
heroes carved upon them, might almost seem one work with the
sterner aisles, but modern windows bespeak the hand of
perpendicularism to have been busy in after-years.&nbsp; To
Lyhart, bishop of the see in the reign of Henry VI., this roof is
attributed, and to his successor Goldwell the continuation of the
design over the choir.&nbsp; Lyhart lies under a stone beneath
his own <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>roof; Goldwell moulders under a tomb
reared in the choir, where he lies in stone, robed in full
canonicals, his feet resting upon a lion.</p>
<p>On the south side of the nave, between the pillars, is the
tomb of Chancellor Spencer.&nbsp; Upon it the chapter formerly
received their rents, and the stone was completely worn by the
frequent ringing of the money.&nbsp; On the same side, further
up, are two elaborately decorated arches in the perpendicular
style, looking strangely at variance with the simplicity
prevailing around.&nbsp; These purport to be the chapel of Bishop
Nix, who lies buried beneath them, and an altar formerly stood at
the foot of the eastern pillar.&nbsp; The iron-work on which hung
the bell, is still visible on the side of the western
pillar.&nbsp; The pulpit stood near here; a faint trace of its
site is discernible against the pillar, but that is all that
remains to speak of the original purpose of this spacious
court.&nbsp; Bishop Nix it was who tried and condemned the martyr
Bilney, whose trial, as all others of the same nature, was
conducted in the consistory court, or Bishop Beauchamp&rsquo;s
chapel, in the south aisle of the choir.&nbsp; In the north aisle
of the nave, between the sixth and seventh pillars, is a
door-way, now closed, and converted into a bench, through which
the people formerly adjourned after prayers in the choir to hear
the sermon, which was preached in the green yard, now the palace
gardens, <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>prior to the Great Rebellion.&nbsp;
Galleries were raised against the walls of the palace, and along
the north wall of the cathedral, for the mayor, aldermen, their
wives and officers, dean, prebends, &amp;c.; the rest of the
audience either stood or sat on forms, paying for their seats a
penny, or half-penny each.&nbsp; The pulpit had a capacious
covering of lead, with a cross upon it.&nbsp; On the church being
sequestered, and the service discontinued during the
Commonwealth, the pulpit was removed to the New Hall Yard, now
the garden of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and the sermons were
preached there.&nbsp; The devastations committed in and about the
building at that period, formed the subject of grievous
lamentations from the pen of good bishop Hall, then the Bishop of
the see, whose sufferings from persecution have become a part of
our country&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Hall spent the last melancholy
years of his life in the little village of Heigham, where the
Dolphin Inn, with its quaint flint-work frontage, mullioned
windows, and curiously carved chamber roof and door, yet remain
to associate the spot with his memory: his tomb is in the little
village church close by.</p>
<p>In the centre of the roof of the nave is a circular hole, the
purpose of which for many years puzzled enquirers; but one of the
industrious and intellectual arch&aelig;ologians of the present
day, to whom we are indebted for many interesting discoveries
connected <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>with the cathedral, has reasonably
suggested that it was the spot from whence was suspended the
large censer swung lengthwise in the nave at the festivals of
Easter and Whitsuntide.&nbsp; On the north side of the choir
there still exists the small oriel window, through which the
sepulchre was watched from Good Friday to Easter Morning.&nbsp;
This ceremony consisted of placing the host in a sepulchre,
erected to represent the holy sepulchre, covering it with crape,
and setting a person or persons to watch it until Easter Sunday,
as the soldiers watched the tomb of Christ.&nbsp; During the
time, no bells sounded, no music was heard, and lights were
extinguished.&nbsp; In silence and gloom these three days were
passed.&nbsp; In reference to the length of time usually so
denominated, that is from Friday to Sunday, a curious solution,
attributed to Christopher Wren, the son of the architect, has
recently been published; he seems to have puzzled himself over
such like problems, and says, &ldquo;that the night in one
hemisphere was day in the other, and the two days in the other
were nights in the opposite,&rdquo; so that in reality there were
three nights and three days on <i>the earth</i>; and as Christ
died for the whole world, not only for the hemisphere in which
Judea was, he therefore truly remained in the grave that
time.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us, accustomed to the sober
undemonstrative, not to say cold demeanour of modern <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Protestantism, to form a conception of the effect of the
seasons of festivity or humiliation, as observed even in our own
land in earlier times.&nbsp; The setting apart the greater
portion of the day for weeks together, for religious ceremonies,
and especially the almost dramatic scenes of the Passion week,
sound to our ears as tales of mummery.&nbsp; Whether we have
gained much by the acquisition of the wisdom that sees nothing in
them but occasion for ridicule, or pity, may be a question.&nbsp;
Certain it is that many of the practices were gross and debasing;
many, had beauty and truth in them.</p>
<p>Amongst those peculiar to the season of Easter, are the
ceremony of creeping to the cross on Good Friday, and the
kindling of the fires and lighting of the paschal on Easter
Eve.&nbsp; As these are distinctly mentioned in ancient Norfolk
wills, as practised in this cathedral, we may just describe them
in connection with our visit to it.&nbsp; It was often customary
to leave lands chargeable with the payment of offerings at this
season, both at the creeping of the cross, and to furnish new
paschals or tapers for lighting at Easter.</p>
<p>The creeping to the cross is mentioned in a proclamation,
black letter, dated 26th February, 30th Henry VIII., in the first
volume of a collection of proclamations in the archives of the
Society of Antiquaries, where it is stated, &ldquo;On Good Friday
it <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>shall be declared how creeping to the cross sygnyfyeth
an humblynge of oneself to Christ before the cross, and the
kyssynge of it a memory of our redemption made upon the
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a letter from Henry to Cranmer, of later
date, a command is issued that the practice should be
discontinued as idolatrous.&nbsp; The ceremony is described by
Davies in his rites of the cathedral church of Durham, where he
relates, &ldquo;that within that church, upon Good Friday, there
was a marvellously solemn service, in which service time, after
the passion was sung, two of the ancient monks took a goodly
large crucifix, all of gold, of the picture of our Saviour Christ
nailed upon the cross, laying it upon a cushion, bringing it
betwixt them thereupon to the lowest greese or step in the choir,
and there did hold the said cross betwixt them.&nbsp; And then
one of the monks did rise, and went a pretty space from it, and
setting himself upon his knees, with his shoes put off very
reverently, <i>he crept upon his knees</i> unto the said cross,
and after him the other did likewise, and then they set down
again on either side of it.&nbsp; Afterward, the prior came forth
from his stall, and in like manner did creep unto the said cross,
and all the monks after him in the said manner, in the meantime
the whole quire singing a hymn.&nbsp; The service being ended,
the two monks carried the cross and the sepulchre with great
reverence; kings, <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>queens, and common people, all
followed the same custom; it was, however, usual to place a
carpet for royal knees to creep upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paschal, or taper as it was called, was lighted from fire
struck from a flint on Easter Eve, all previous fires being
extinguished.&nbsp; The paschal was often of great size: that of
Westminster Abbey, in 1557, weighed three hundred pounds.&nbsp;
Many curious records of church disbursements for these and such
like things are recorded; in those of St. Mary-at-Hill, in
London, stands, &ldquo;For a quarter of coles for the hallowed
fire of Easter Eve, 6<i>d.</i>; also for two men to watch the
sepulchre, from Good Friday to Easter Eve, 14<i>d.</i>; for a
piece of timber to the new paschal, 2<i>s.</i>; paid for a dish
of pewter for the paschal, 8<i>d</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church on Easter morning presented another scene.&nbsp;
The sepulchre removed, tapers were lighted, fires kindled,
incense burned, music pealed from the bells, Te Deums from
organs, flowers fresh gathered lent their fragrance to the hour,
birds set loose from the crowd, all joined to celebrate the
joyful festival of the resurrection, and altars glittered with
the whole wealth of silver and gold, that munificence or
penitence had enriched them with.&nbsp; We have left off all
these things&mdash;but we sing the Easter hymn.</p>
<p>On the north side of the entrance from the nave into the
anti-choir was placed the chapel, dedicated <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to the Lady
of Pity; and above the spot where Herbert laid the foundation
stone, was placed the altar, dedicated to St. William.&nbsp; As
this sounds rather an unsaintly name, we must explain that St.
William was a little boy, aged nine years, who, in the time of
Rufus, when the Jews were powerful in our land, fell a martyr to
their hatred of the Christians.&nbsp; The tale runs that, in
1137, the Jews, then the leading merchants, doctors, and scholars
of the day, stole a little boy, crucified him, and buried him in
Thorpe wood.&nbsp; They were discovered on their road to the
burial, but escaped punishment by some clever monetary
arrangement with the authorities.&nbsp; Little William was buried
in the wood, and a chapel raised above his grave, the outline of
which is yet discernible by the fineness of the grass, that
distinguishes it from the heath around, the wood having long
since narrowed its limits; the shepherds say weeds will not grow
on the spot, for it is &ldquo;hallowed ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
bones of the unfortunate boy were afterwards brought to the
cathedral, where another shrine was erected, and dedicated to the
little saint; and Thomas, a monk of Monmouth, is said to have
written <i>seven</i> books of the miracles wrought by these
bones.&nbsp; It was essential, before a saint could be canonized,
that three miracles should be proved to have been wrought by him
in life, or after death; hence, no doubt, the efforts of the monk
to prove their potency, as the <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>youth of the
martyr would render it doubly essential to establish his claims
to the honour indubitably.&nbsp; The body of a saint, by act of
canonization, was placed in a sarcophagus, an altar raised over
it, where mass was said continually, to secure his or her
mediation.</p>
<p>Above the anti-choir was the rood loft, in which were kept the
reliques, and on which was erected the principal rood or cross,
with the figure of the Saviour carved on it.&nbsp; The rood loft
was always placed between the nave and choir, signifying that
those who would go from the church militant, which the nave then
represented, into the church triumphant, must go under the cross,
and suffer affliction.&nbsp; The festival of the cross was and is
called Holy Rood Day, and was instituted first on account of the
recovery of a large piece of the cross by the Emperor Heraclius,
after it had been taken away, on the plundering of Jerusalem by
Chosroes, king of Persia, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
615.&nbsp; Rood and cross are synonymous.&nbsp; The rood, when
perfectly made, had not only the figure of Christ on it, but
those of the Virgin and St. John, one on each side, in allusion
to their presence at the Crucifixion.</p>
<p>Besides the rood, this loft also once contained a
representation of the Trinity, superbly gilt; the Father
blasphemously figured as an old man, with the Saviour Christ on
the cross, between his knees, <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and the Holy
Spirit, in the form of a dove, on his breast.&nbsp; This image
was ornamented with a gold chain, weighing nearly eight ounces, a
large jewel, with a red rose enamelled in gold, hanging on it,
and four smaller jewels.&nbsp; A silver collar was also presented
to it in 1443, that had been bestowed upon some knight as a mark
of honour.&nbsp; Among the relics was a portion of the blood of
the Virgin, to which numbers came in pilgrimage, and made
offerings.&nbsp; Whether or no it liquefied at stated seasons,
like that of St. Genaro, is not recorded.</p>
<p>It is not pleasant to watch the growth of such gross
materialisms over the sacred truths and symbols of Christian
worship; nor can we wonder at the re-actionary enthusiasm that
came and swept them all away, however much good taste may deplore
the loss of many beauties and solid treasures, that disappeared
amid the tumult of the &ldquo;dissolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing beneath the rood loft, now the gallery for one of the
finest organs and choirs our country can boast, we enter the
choir, which, as it extends westward considerably beyond the
tower, is of unusual length, and imposing in its effect; the
lantern, or lower part of the tower, rising in the centre,
supported by four noble arches, that bear the weight of the whole
tower and spire, is impressively beautiful, albeit modern
decorators have been at work to spoil the harmony that should
prevail, by medallions <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and wreaths that should have no place
there, however pretty in themselves.</p>
<p>The connoisseur may here find an abundant field to exercise
his architectural knowledge, in deciding the various dates of the
several portions of this beautiful part of the building.&nbsp;
The long row of stalls, with their high-backed and projecting
canopies, crowned with multitudes of crocketted pinnacles, the
richly decorated screen-work, that shuts out the plainer Norman
aisles, the mysterious-looking triforium running round the
curious apsidal termination, the light clerestory, with its tier
of windows, divided by feathered and canopied niches, whence
spring the main ribs of the vaulted roof,&mdash;form a whole,
that it needs no skill in art or science to be enabled to
appreciate and enjoy.&nbsp; Of painted glass, perhaps the less
said the better&mdash;we may be wanting in taste or judgment;
certain it is, it forms no very prominent feature of beauty, and
a kaliedoscope of mediocre arrangement, and a rather indifferent
illumination transparency, may, we fancy, each find a counterpart
among the specimens of colour that do exist.&nbsp; Something is
in progress&mdash;perhaps on an improved scale.</p>
<p>But we must not omit to glance at a few of the quaint old
carvings, that remain almost as sole relics of the ancient
furniture of the church.&nbsp; Entering any stall, we observe the
seat turns up on hinges, <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and beneath
is a narrow ledge, which it has been presumed was a contrivance
to relieve the old monks from the fatigue of standing, during the
parts of the service where that position is prescribed by the
rubric; they were supposed to lean upon these ledges in a
half-sitting posture; but a much more reasonable conjecture is,
that they were intended as rests for the elbows and missal when
kneeling in prayer; a glance at them when turned up instantly
suggests the idea of a <i>prie dieu</i>, which they closely
resemble.&nbsp; The lower parts of these <i>misereres</i>, as
they were called, are decorated in a most elaborate manner with
carving, and supported by bosses, sometimes of one or more
figures, often foliage, fruit, and flowers, or shields.&nbsp;
Among them may be found the figures of a lion and dragon biting
each other; owls and little birds fighting; Sampson in armour (?)
slaying the lion; monkeys fighting, one holding a rod, another in
a wheelbarrow; the prodigal son feeding swine; a monk tearing a
dog&rsquo;s hind legs; another flogging a little boy, amid a
group of other urchins; and numerous other equally inexplicable
designs.&nbsp; If, indeed, such objects did occupy the place
under the eyes of the monks at their devotions, they must have
served admirably to train the risible muscles to
self-command.</p>
<p>It is among these carvings that the presumed satires are to be
found, that are attributed to the dissensions <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>existing
between the secular and regular clergy, about the period of the
building of the Cathedral; they would have us interpret them as
something akin to liberty of the press, with all its caprices,
sarcasms, and ironical sneers; but as the self-same subjects have
been found to range over the works of the carvers from the
thirteenth century down to the Reformation, and on the Continent
as well as in this country, it is much more probable that they
were copies from the illustrations of books, at that time
popular, or from the illuminations of fanciful legends, upon
which the monks were continually engaged, and which were always
at hand to serve as patterns for the workmen.&nbsp; The
Bestiaria, a work very celebrated, has been suggested as the
source of many of the figures; among its pages figured mermaids,
unicorns, dragons, &amp;c.; and the calendars also, in which the
agricultural pursuits of each month were depicted on the top of
the page, might form another copy to be modelled from.&nbsp; Such
is the most probable way of accounting for the presence of such
objects, although it is possible that in an age when the church
offered scope for every talent to display itself, so, obscure
recesses were found for the offspring of these original, though
not very refined, creations of fancy, often, however, executed by
the hands of skilful craftsmen.</p>
<p>One look at the antique specimen of the reading <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>desk&mdash;a pelican supporting it with the clot of
blood on its breast, symbolizing, we are told, the shedding of
the blood of Christ, as that bird sheds its blood for its
young.&nbsp; It may, or may not be so&mdash;but if it be, it is
indeed a gross substitute for the eagle, a symbol that has at
least poetry and spirituality to recommend it.</p>
<p>Beyond this, and behind the high altar, in the recess of the
apse, once stood the bishop&rsquo;s throne, a plain stone chair,
in the days when the priests did occupy their places in the
church.&nbsp; The seat may still be seen in the aisle, at the
back of this spot, by any one adventurous enough to climb a
ladder, and peep into a niche they will find high up in the
wall.</p>
<p>We let pulpits and thrones of the present day speak for
themselves, and leaving the choir, take a brief look at the fine
old chapels of St. Luke and Jesus, on the north and south side of
the apse.&nbsp; The former still remains in good preservation,
and is used as the parish church of St. Mary in the Marsh,
destroyed by Herbert, the founder of both these chapels, as well
as the Cathedral.&nbsp; The only font within the precincts is
here; it is an ancient affair, brought hither from the demolished
church, and is decorated with carvings, representing the seven
sacraments, the four evangelists, and divers figures of popes,
saints, confessors, &amp;c.&nbsp; Over this chapel is the
treasury of the dean and chapter, from amongst whose <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>stores, hid up where moth and rust do corrupt, a
beautiful and curious painting of scenes in the life of Christ,
has been of late years rescued, and promoted to the honour of a
place in the vestry room (the ancient prison of the monastery),
where it has been placed under a glass case.&nbsp; It appears to
have served originally as some part of the decoration of an
altar, and was set in a frame, the mouldings of which are richly
diapered and ornamented with gilding, with impressed work and
fragments of coloured glass inserted at intervals, a mode of
enrichment of which specimens are very rare in this
country.&nbsp; The corners of the frame had been removed to adapt
it to the purpose of a table, at the period of the great
&ldquo;dissolution,&rdquo; where it had remained with its back
serving for the top of the required table, until accident
revealed it to the eyes of arch&aelig;ological research.</p>
<p>The painting is divided into five compartments, each on a
separate panel, the subjects being the Flagellation of Christ,
Christ bearing the Cross, the Crucifixion, and the
Ascension.&nbsp; The entire back-grounds of the paintings are
gilded and diapered in curious patterns, and the ornaments, such
as the bosses of the harness on the horses of the soldiers, the
goldsmith&rsquo;s work on the cingulum or belt, are in slight
relief.&nbsp; This mode of painting is described as being
executed upon a thin coating of composition, made of whiting and
white of egg, laid on the <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>oaken panel;
upon this the outline of the design was traced with a red line,
and the spaces designed to receive gilding were then marked out
with fresh whitening and egg; the stems marked with a modelling
tool, and leaves added by filling moulds with the paste, and
fixing them by pressure on the surface of the picture; the
puncture work and little toolings were then produced, and the
modelling finished.&nbsp; The gilded portions were next covered
with gold leaf, and the artist proceeded with his pictures, using
transparent colours liquefied by white of egg.</p>
<p>At the extreme end of the Cathedral once stood another chapel,
dedicated to St. Mary the Great, of considerable note in early
times&mdash;the offerings at the high altar amounting to immense
sums&mdash;daily mass was said here for the founder&rsquo;s soul
in particular, his friends, relations, benefactors, &amp;c.&nbsp;
The chapel was about seventy feet long and thirty broad, and had
a handsome entrance from the church; it has long since
disappeared.&nbsp; The Jesus chapel on the opposite side is
rather a melancholy looking place at present, one high tomb of
some pretensions in the centre alone distinguishing it from a
lumber room; near this chapel, in the north aisle, is the
speculatory before alluded to, as the opening through which the
sepulchre was watched at Easter; it has, until recently, been
called the ancient &ldquo;confessional,&rdquo; a somewhat
extraordinary position for such a priestly office to be exercised
in, as were <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>it so, the penitent must of necessity
have stood in the aisle on tiptoe to reach the ear of his
confessor in the choir, who must equally of necessity have lain
upon the ground to receive the confession.</p>
<p>And now we must pass on to the cloisters, where one almost
involuntarily cries out for &ldquo;the monks of old,&rdquo; to
come and give life to the walks among the tombs, no other earthly
figure or garb, save a cowled monk, seeming to have place in such
a scene.&nbsp; The long lines of beautiful windows, on the one
side of pure early English tracery, on another of the decorated
period, and another line still more elaborate in its turnings and
twistings, while the last bespeaks the perpendicularism that
prevails among so many of the windows of the church&mdash;each
and all are beautiful.&nbsp; The splendidly carved doorway
entering into the church, that has puzzled learned and simple
alike to interpret truly, is a gem, and the perfectly preserved
lavatories at the opposite corner have their own features of
interest.&nbsp; The roof, groined and vaulted with sculptured
bosses, is covered with fanciful and legendary carvings&mdash;the
martyrdoms of saints, St. Anthony roasting on his gridiron,
&amp;c., St. John the Baptist and Herodias with his head in a
charger; the mutilated body of another headless saint has
received from some kind charitable hand the blessing of a new
head, while the old one is under his arm; the date of this
addition or growth is uncertain&mdash;it <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>looks very
white, rather new; above the door leading into the ancient
refectory is a carving of the Temptation, Adam and Eve and the
serpent as usual; about this said carving hangs a tale, another
than the story of the Fall of man, and too good to be
omitted.&nbsp; The great historian of this comity, and all the
little historians that have condensed, contracted, extracted, and
dove-tailed little bits of his history together, have all with
wonderful precision agreed that above this arch was carved the
<i>espousals</i> or Sacrament of Marriage; and upon that
foundation, or perhaps rather <i>under</i> that head we should
say, entered into elaborate details of how this spot was the
chosen site for the celebration of the sacrament of marriage,
which every one knows was performed in the <i>porch</i> of the
church, and not in the church itself as now, but as this spot is
a very considerable number of yards distant from either church or
porch, some of those troublesome people who will be continually
saying Why? and seeking for a Because, began to look for these
<i>espousals</i>, and found only a <i>Temptation</i>.&nbsp; One
of these individuals, of a peculiarly persevering nature,
earnestly desirous of reconciling these strange discrepancies
between the assertion of a respectable old historian, and his own
eye-sight, set to work, and the following was the result.&nbsp;
He found that much of this good historian&rsquo;s description of
the cloister was a tolerably free translation of an old Latin
work by <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>William of Worcester, the original
manuscript of which exists in the library of Corpus Christi, at
Cambridge.&nbsp; It was printed and edited, many years ago, by
one Nasmith, and an extract is to be found in the last edition of
the Monasticon, where the work of a bishop who built one side of
the cloister is described as extending to the arches, &ldquo;in
quibus maritagia dependent,&rdquo; which must be translated
&ldquo;in which the espousals or marriages hang.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now
it seemed to this inquisitive individual that a very trivial
error of the transcriber might have entirely altered the sense of
the passage; that if the word &ldquo;maritagia&rdquo; should turn
out to be &ldquo;manut&rsquo;gia&rdquo; for
&ldquo;manutergia,&rdquo; all the mystery would be
explained.&nbsp; Upon inquiry, and inspection of the original
manuscript, this proved a correct surmise on the part of the
ingenious as well as inquisitive individual, and the arches in
which the (manutergia) <i>towels</i> hang, <i>close by the
lavatories</i>, turn out to be the substitute for the arches in
which the <i>espousals hang</i>.&nbsp; Overlooking the single
stroke of a pen, produced these queer misconceptions <i>for above
a century</i>.</p>
<p>The following is an epitaph composed for Jacob Freeman, who
was buried in the cloister yard, where he used often to lie upon
a hill and sleep, with his head upon a stone.&nbsp; The old man
was very hardly used by the <i>committee</i> for so doing, and
for frequenting church porches, and repeating the <i>common</i>
prayer <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to the people, in spite of ill
treatment, he being often sent to Bridewell, whipped and reproved
for it.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">EPITAPH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in this homely cabinet,<br />
Resteth a poor old anchoret;<br />
Upon the ground he laid all weathers,<br />
Not as most men, goose-like, on feathers,<br />
For so indeed it came to pass,<br />
The Lord of lords his landlord was;<br />
He lived, instead of wainscot rooms,<br />
Like the possessed, among the tombs.<br />
As by some spirit thither led,<br />
To be acquainted with the dead:<br />
Each morning, from his bed so hallowed,<br />
He rose, took up his cross, and followed;<br />
To every porch he did repair,<br />
To vent himself in common prayer,<br />
Wherein he was alone devout,<br />
When <i>preaching</i>, <i>jostled</i>, <i>praying out</i>,<br />
In sad procession through the city,<br />
Maugre the devil or committee,<br />
He daily went, for which he fell<br />
Not into <i>Jacob&rsquo;s</i>, but <i>Bridewell</i>,<br />
Where you might see his loyal back<br />
Red-lettered, like an almanack;<br />
Or I may rather else aver,<br />
Dominickt, like a calendar;<br />
And him triumphing at that harm,<br />
Having nought else to keep him warm.<br />
With Paul he always prayed, no wonder<br />
The lash did keep his flesh still under;<br />
Yet whip-cord seemed to lose its sting,<br />
When for the church, or for the king,<br />
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>High loyalty in such a death<br />
Could battle torments with mean earth;<br />
And though such sufferings he did pass,<br />
In spite of bonds, still <i>Freeman</i> was.<br />
&rsquo;Tis well his pate was weather-proof;<br />
The palace like it had no roof;<br />
The hair was off, and &rsquo;twas the fashion,<br />
The <i>crown</i> being <i>under sequestration</i>.<br />
Tho&rsquo; bald as time and mendicant,<br />
No fryer yet, but Protestant&mdash;<br />
His head each morning and each even<br />
Was watered with the dews of heaven.<br />
He lodged alike, dead and alive,<br />
As one that did his grave survive,<br />
For he is now, though he be dead,<br />
But in a manner put to bed,<br />
His cabin being above ground yet,<br />
Under a thin turf coverlet.<br />
Pity he in no porch did lay,<br />
Who did in porches so much pray;<br />
Yet let him have this Epitaph:<br />
Here sleeps poor Jacob, stone and staff.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must not close our chapter on cathedrals and bishops
without some little further notice of the more important branch
of the subject, although we venture not upon biographies of the
many whose names shine forth from among the list of
&ldquo;spiritual fathers,&rdquo; well meriting more detailed
sketching than would be here in place.&nbsp; Hall, Nix, Lyhart,
and Goldwell, have had their share of passing comment, but there
are other names that must not be looked over in silence.&nbsp;
Among the earliest stands Pandulph, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the notorious
legate from the Pope, during the troubled reign of John, when
disputes about the appointment of Stephen Langton to the
archbishopric of Canterbury had had our country under the
interdict of his papal majesty; and for six years all Christian
rites were suppressed, save baptism and confirmation, in
consequence of jealousies between these rival powers upon the
vexed question of the right of investiture.&nbsp; It was mainly
through the agency of Pandulph that the king was at last inclined
to submit, in return for which the bishopric of this diocese was
conferred on the successful diplomatist.&nbsp; Walter de
Suffield, another name of at least great local repute, was the
founder of the Old Man&rsquo;s Hospital, an institution at this
day in the receipt of &pound;10,000 a year, out of which some
<i>two hundred</i> old men and women are maintained in clothes,
food, and a shilling a day, and <i>lodged</i> in a beautiful
<i>old church</i>, founded by Lyhart at a later period, the
trustees of such a fund thinking this arrangement preferable to
restoring the church to its original use, and providing more
suitable buildings for the accommodation of the recipients of the
charity.&nbsp; The tomb of Suffield, in his own chapel, at the
east end of the cathedral, became a shrine for worship, to which
pilgrimages were frequent, and miracles in abundance were said to
be wrought.</p>
<p>Percy, brother of the famous Earl of Northumberland, <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>was
another who wore the mitre of the see; he lies buried before the
roodloft door.&nbsp; Henry de Spencer, the warrior bishop, is
another, who raised and headed an army of three thousand men, and
conducted it in person to Flanders, where he figured prominently
in the wars between Richard and the French king, as well as in
the struggles of Urban and Clement for the papacy.&nbsp; His
military fame was rivalled by his notorious zeal in the cause of
his church, evidenced by unmitigated persecution of the Lollards,
whose adherence to the doctrines of Wickliffe was rewarded by
every variety of penance or punishment that could be devised to
exterminate the heresy.&nbsp; A splendid monument of this spirit
of the man and age is left us in the magnificent gateway opposite
the West entrance to the cathedral, erected by Sir Thomas
Erpingham, at the bidding of De Spencer, as a penance for his
sympathy with these heretical doctrines.&nbsp; Above the doorway
is an effigy of himself in armour, kneeling and asking pardon for
his offence.&nbsp; Rugg&mdash;an instrument of Henry&rsquo;s, in
obtaining the divorce of Catherine of Arragon; Hopkin&mdash;a
notorious persecutor of the Protestants in Mary&rsquo;s reign;
Parkhurst&mdash;a literary celebrity; Wren&mdash;the victim of
Puritanism, which placed him a prisoner in the tower for eighteen
years without a trial; Butts&mdash;a friend of Cranmer; Horne,
whose letters on infidelity have given him a fame; and <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Bathurst, respected in the memory of many yet living;
are names conspicuous in the catalogue; not yet complete without
two others, Stanley and Hinde.&nbsp; Of Hinde we can but say his
work is yet in hand, he is earning his place in history, for some
future pen to chronicle; but may be, no fitter subject could be
offered for a closing scene to this chapter on the bishops and
cathedral of this see, than memory can recal of that day, when
beneath the lofty nave of the one, a grave was opened to receive
the mortal remains of the loved and honoured Stanley.&nbsp; Who,
among the thousands that then gathered themselves together,
wearing not alone the outer symbols of mourning and grief, but
carrying in their hearts deep sorrow, and in their eyes
<i>unbidden</i> tears&mdash;who will forget the solemn stillness
of the thronged multitude as the simple pall was borne, unmocked
by plumes or other idle trappings of fictitious woe, through the
avenues of unhired mutes, whose heads were bowed in heartfelt
reverence, and lines of infant mourners, clad in the livery of
their benefactor&rsquo;s bounty, and watering the pathway to his
tomb with honest tears of childhood&rsquo;s love&mdash;the
attitudes of grief and saddened faces that filled the crowded
aisles, and no less crowded walks above&mdash;the hushed
breathing that left the air free to echo the tones of the wailing
dirge, as it rose upon the voices of the surpliced choir, who
mourned <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>a child of harmony, and wafted their
strains of lamentation through all the heights of the vaulted
roof, while beneath its centre the grave was receiving the
earthly tabernacle of the good, the noble-hearted, and the great
in deeds of love and charity?&nbsp; Who does not remember the
measured tread of the dispersing thousands, as each took his last
look of the simple coffin in its last resting-place, and as the
dead march sent forth its full low notes from the organ&rsquo;s
peal, and the rich closing bursts of harmony proclaimed like a
rush of mighty wind the soul&rsquo;s release and triumph? and who
has not often since lingered around the simple marble slab that
marks the spot, and felt that it had been consecrated as a
shrine, by a baptism of tears from the fountain of loving hearts
on that memorable day?</p>

<p>In the centre of the Old City rises one of those huge mounds,
heaped up by our ancient warrior forefathers, which here and
there, over the surface of our island, yet stand out in bold
relief against the blue back-ground of the sky, like giant models
for some modern monster twelfth-cake, only, however, occasionally
crowned by the original structures, of which they were the
ground-works, and in no other case, perhaps by one whose outward
coating of modern date more thoroughly might carry out the
suggested idea of a frosted moulding, designed to grace the
summit of a supper-table fortification.</p>
<p>How involuntary is the longing to peel off the <!-- page
63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>pasty
composition and find the substance hidden beneath, be it as
crumbly and mottled as the most luscious monument ever reared in
honour of the feast of the Epiphany, from the era of the Magi
downwards.&nbsp; But so it may not be; the flinty roughnesses of
the past are hidden from our eyes by the soft covering of refined
stucco, and we must be content with the attempt of ingenious
modern masonry to give us an impress of what the castle called
Blanchflower was, in lieu of beholding it unspoiled save by the
hand of time.&nbsp; It is, however, something to know that there
really does exist beneath that outer casing, a bon&acirc; fide
mass of flint and stone, some portions of which at least have
stood, even from the days of the sea-king Canute; by him raised
on the site of the royal residence of East Anglian princes, and
yet earlier dwelling place of Gurguntus and other British kings,
and by him suffered to retain the name of
&ldquo;Blanchflower,&rdquo; first given, so legends say, by one
of its royal owners in honour of his mother, Blanche, a kinswoman
of the mighty C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; There it yet stands, its very
roots planted high above the topmost stories of all meaner
habitations, its battlements towering to the sky, as though
climbing from their earthen base through the turrets and towers,
reared as a stronghold for human pride and ambition, to heights
that would rival the lofty spire in the valley beneath, that
blends itself with <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the heaven to which it points in the
solemn attitude of silent devotion, as if to ask, &ldquo;Which
can do the greatest works, man serving man, or man serving
God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the monuments of two such spirits side by-side, fancy
might wander into perfect labyrinths of mystic and speculative
thought, not void of beauty, tracing the unseen workings of the
spirit-powers there sought to be embodied, each lingering about
and shedding itself around the temple consecrated as its
shrine&mdash;devotion, yet meetly expressed in the tapering
spire&mdash;human Despotism and human frailty, finding in every
age a fitting representative within the lordly castles of the
robber chiefs, from the day when its walls formed the boundary of
life to feudal wives and slaves, and its dungeons, the tombs of
vanquished foes, through every age of its isolated grandeur, down
to the picture of aggregated solitudes and woes, that it presents
in the character now assigned to it, of a prison-home for
criminals.</p>
<p>But for some such sense of the invisible links that make the
present purposes to which its limits are devoted, one with the
past, there might seem to be much difficulty in connecting the
picture of the felon-town now enclosed within its walls, with any
associations of history; or the accumulations of red brick,
slate-roofed ranges of well-lighted, well-ventilated and
comfortable chambers, made dark or miserable <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span><i>only</i>
by the spirits that tenant them, with the ideas or expectations a
castle-prison could suggest.&nbsp; That such should be the only
<i>cells</i> to be found or seen, is to the eye and ear of mere
curiosity an absolute disappointment.&nbsp; One feels half angry
at the sudden annihilation of the vague and undefined fillings up
that fancy had given to the outline of the feudal relic.&nbsp;
The learned may know it all before-hand, but the uninitiated
cannot fail to receive an unwelcome surprise, in finding the
substantial and important looking keep, withal its crust of
stucco, little more than a shell, whose kernel is made up of
modern habitations, as fresh-looking as though they had but
yesterday sprung up as pimples on the face of nature, a title not
inappropriate to most red brick emanations of architectural
skill.&nbsp; But our visit to the Castle must not be spent in
such vague lamentations over what is <i>not</i>; neither would we
in our regrets desire to be classed among the morbid cravers
after horrors, that can find pleasure in condemned cells,
gibbets, chains associated with murderers, or any such like
appurtenances of a county gaol; thankfully we claim exemption
from any such mental disease, nor even as the chroniclers of
facts would we dwell one moment on the points of detail that
would pander to such a taste in our fellow beings.</p>
<p>A prison must ever teem with painful associations, one
scarcely more so than another, nor does the fact <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of an
apartment, in no way differing from those around it, having been
tenanted by a Rush, whom some would call the mighty among
murderers, make it an object to our ideas more worthy either a
visit or description.&nbsp; The simple initials in the wall of
the prison-yard, above the dishonoured grave where he lies, with
the few others who have met a like miserable fate, speak to the
heart&mdash;and we turn from them with an inward whispering,
there&mdash;who was <i>his</i> murderer?&mdash;was it justice,
human or Divine?&nbsp; Did the child speak with folly, or
childhood&rsquo;s own wisdom, when it asked if Rush died for
breaking God&rsquo;s commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not
kill,&rdquo; <i>did</i> not those who killed him also break
it?&nbsp; Such is not fiction&mdash;its simple baby logic answers
for it&mdash;but we say as to the child&rsquo;s query, We cannot
answer you.&nbsp; Many a great and noble heart recognises the
minister of justice, as God&rsquo;s own delegate, to claim the
yielding up of his Creature&rsquo;s life, a satisfaction to the
broken laws of God and man.&nbsp; Many as great and noble, and we
would think as mindful of the great ends of justice and design of
punishment, would say, Leave the gift of God, the breath of life,
at His disposal, who has said, &ldquo;Vengeance is
mine;&rdquo;&mdash;trust to <i>His justice</i> as to <i>His
mercy</i>, to which alone you appeal, when sending the soul into
his presence, reeking with guilt and sin.&nbsp; As spoke the
child, on that sad, solemn day of darkness,&mdash;when the spirit
of sin <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>seemed to breathe over the debased
city, and spread its contaminations through every channel where
its subtle essence could find an inlet, till the moral vision of
the very purest seemed to be obscured, and the atmosphere tainted
for a while, by the sickening familiarity with the face of
crime;&mdash;the last day of the wretched victim of unrestrained
passions in life and in death,&mdash;whose struggles of vanity
and egotism, with the quailings of the flesh, evidenced by the
whitening hair, the trembling hand, and vapid mutterings, through
a trial prolonged to an unheard-of length, had drawn around him a
host of witnesses, almost without a parallel in history; and not
alone of the mass of unlearned and ignorant, whom we are wont to
charge with insensibility and coarseness, nor of the stern
philosopher, nor even sickly religionists, who find some
concealed duty in witnessing elaborations of torture, but of the
gentle hearts that move within the mothers and daughters of
England; and white-gloved and richly-dressed ladies thronged to
use the tickets that gained them privileged entrance to a gallery
that overlooked this spectacle of human agony&mdash;(oh! is there
one among that assembled galaxy of England&rsquo;s fair ones that
can recal that scene, without a shudder and a blush for the very
refinements that cast their cloak around the horrors of the
reality?)&mdash;that day,&mdash;when the festivities of concert
and party over, when the merriment of the <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>bustling,
noisy fair outside the court of trial had died away, and room was
left for the last act of the drama&mdash;as then, the child
lifted up its saddened voice, with its question so quaintly
simple&mdash;so was it echoed back to us from the grave of that
poor criminal, and a torrent of memories, linked with that
fearful time, came flooding back upon us, as the fruit of the
tree of crime, whose seed was then sown before our eyes, seemed
to lie scattered at our feet, in the later-made grave, and
sin-filled cells around us.&nbsp; But enough of this&mdash;the
darkest tragedy of later days associated with our castle
prison&mdash;how many more silent, but not less sad, have been
enacted within its limits, in chambers now inaccessible to human
tread, we may not know! how many death sighs have been breathed
out from its hidden dungeons, how many spirits violently sundered
from their earthly tabernacles, and sent wandering through
eternity before a home had been prepared for their rest, the
record books of earth yield no account, but they are registered
above; shall it avail to plead, &ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s
keeper?&rdquo; when the great final day of reckoning shall come,
and the judges and rulers of the earth shall be summoned to give
an account of their stewardship?&nbsp; But these are <i>not</i>
the thoughts awakened upon crossing the threshold of this portal,
for, strange to say, the first greeting offered us, is the
smiling welcome of gay, liberty-loving <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>flowers,
blooming as sweetly and merrily in that atmosphere of sin and
sorrow, as ever they could have done on mountain heath or
valley&rsquo;s dell.&nbsp; Who knows what messages of hope and
love these simple tenants of the miniature conservatory have
breathed to weary, sin-laden hearts, bowed down in penitence for
guilt!&nbsp; There was kindness in the heart that placed them
there, and justice is blessed in owning servitors that do her
bidding with such gentle mien.&nbsp; Modern prisons, their
advantages and defects, have formed subjects for the pens of many
writers; no need, therefore, that we longer dwell on this aspect
of our city stronghold.&nbsp; Colonies of zebra-clad prisoners
tenant the wards, and thread the intricate passages leading
through tiers and radiating wings of cells, so cunningly arranged
that, amid all the appearance of congregations, separation and
solitude is ensured, even upon the giant wheel itself, and still
further, even in the place for worship, where boardings,
shelvings, and all manner of strangely devised contrivances,
prevent communion between the several classes of the unfortunate,
that suspected and condemned may not mingle, the felony and the
misdemeanour may not be in juxtaposition; these are the features
that meet the eye, and it would not be right to leave such
judicious arrangements unnoticed,&mdash;albeit our visit to the
castle walls may have more to do with its past than present
history.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Tradition assigns the foundation of this castle to
Gurguntus, the son of Belinus, the twenty-fourth king of Britain
from Brutus, who, having observed in the east part of Britain a
place well fitted by nature for the building a fortress on,
founded a certain castle of a square form, and of white stone, on
the top of a high hill near a river, which castle was completed
by his successor, Guthulinus, who &ldquo;encompassed it with a
wall, bank, and double ditches, and made within it subterraneous
vaults of a long and blind or intricate extent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another early writer ascribes to Julius C&aelig;sar the honour of
being its founder, and explains the origin of certain rents and
fissures, perceptible in its sides before its recent restoration,
to the earthquake that shook the earth &ldquo;when the vail of
the temple was rent in twain;&rdquo;&mdash;he adds, that
afterwards Thenatius, Lud&rsquo;s son by marriage with Blanche,
kinswoman of Julius, gave it the name of
&ldquo;Blancheflower.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others attribute this title to
the whiteness of its walk, and assign to the Normans its
appropriation to the edifice they found existing here.</p>
<p>Without doubt, as the metropolis of the Iceni, it was an
important place prior to the advent of the Saxons, who made it
the royal seat of the kings of East Anglia, and afterwards the
residence of governors, called aldermen, dukes, or earls.&nbsp;
During the Danish wars, the castle was often lost and won again,
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>until Alfred the Great wholly subdued the Danes, and he
is said to have greatly improved its fortifications.&nbsp; The
original structure, however, is said to have fallen a sacrifice
to the ravages of the Danes under Sweyn, and the present edifice
is attributed to Canute, his son, upon his return after his
flight upon the accession of Ethelred.&nbsp; The supposition of
its being the work of the Normans after the Conquest is totally
refuted by the events recorded as having transpired within its
precincts, while in the custody of Ralph Guader, who took
possession of it in the seventh year of William&rsquo;s
reign.&nbsp; The elevation upon which the castle and its
fortifications were founded, some writers have conjectured to be
originally the work of heathen worshippers, who raised such like
giant temples to the sun; others have suggested the possibility
of its forming a portion of the famous Icknild Way.</p>
<p>This, in common with other military structures of the same
period, which were mostly built upon one plan, their chief
strength consisting in their height and inaccessibility,
originally included within its boundaries a considerable space of
ground; the outer ballium (bailey or court) having an elevation
of about one hundred feet above the level of the river; and the
inner, upon which stands the keep, raised by art about twenty
feet higher, with the soil of the inner ditch&mdash;still remain
entire; originally <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>three ditches surrounded the castle,
from their circular form betokening great antiquity; the second
and third have been long filled up and built over, but are
distinctly traceable to the eye of persevering enquiry.</p>
<p>The original entrance to the outer court was from Burgh
Street, at the end of which was the barbican, or passage leading
to the first draw-bridge and gate; the second was opposite, and
intermediate between it and the present bridge; a draw-bridge
formerly occupied the site of the present road-way across, at the
end of which stood the gateway for raising it with a strong tower
above it, only removed within the last century.</p>
<p>Two round towers at the upper end of the draw-bridge, whose
foundations still remain, constituted additional defences of the
upper ballium.&nbsp; Connected with the tower on the west side,
were dungeons or vaults, until recently in use for prisoners
before their committal.</p>
<p>The keep, which occupies but a small portion of the original
plan, is about seventy feet high, and ninety-two feet long, by
ninety-six broad.</p>
<p>The walls are composed of flint rubble, faced with Caen stone,
intermixed with a stone found in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The keep bore the same relation to the castle as the citadel
to a fortified town; it was the last <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>retreat of
the garrison, and contained the apartments of the baron or
commandant.&nbsp; Little of these is, however, left us to
explore; the outer wall with its ornamental arches being, as we
before hinted, nothing more than a shell surrounding an open
yard, now filled by detached modern buildings, occupying the site
of the spacious and magnificent chambers that once filled the
interior.</p>
<p>Upon the surface of these walls, within are distinctly
traceable the original openings to the various compartments, now
filled up by masonry; but within the memory of some yet living,
the dungeons and storehouses of the basement story were standing,
and were accessible by stair-cases in the north-east and
south-west angles.</p>
<p>The entrance to the first floor is on the east side, by a
flight of steps leading to a platform projecting outside fourteen
feet from the wall.&nbsp; It is now covered in, and forms a
spacious vestibule, having three open arches towards the east,
one on the north, and one on the south, in which is the
entrance.&nbsp; It is usually called Bigod&rsquo;s tower, its
erection being by some attributed to Roger Bigod, in the reign of
William Rufus, and by others to Hugh Bigod, during the twelfth
century; the whole of it has undergone restoration.&nbsp; The
doorway from the vestibule is through an archway of Saxon
character, supported by five columns with ornamented capitals;
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>two columns only remain; upon the capital of the first,
on the left, is a bearded huntsman in the act of blowing a horn,
with a sword by his side, and holding with his left hand a dog in
slips, which appears to be attacking an ox; on the second capital
is another huntsman, spearing a wild boar of an unusual size.</p>
<p>The fable of the wolf and lamb, the wolf and crane, a
monstrous head and arms, attached to the bodies of two lions, are
amongst the other ornamental carvings, traceable on the other
portions of the capitals and arches, but greatly mutilated.</p>
<p>Prior to the restoration of the tower, this archway had been
totally concealed by masonry; it is only surprising, therefore,
that so much of it should still be in so good a state of
preservation.</p>
<p>A corridor led from this entrance to the chapel, which was on
this floor in the south-east angle, with an oratory or sanctum in
the corner, separated from it by an archway supported by two
columns, the capitals of which are ornamented, and at the angles
are figures of pelicans.&nbsp; The columns are decidedly Norman,
the costumes and helmets bearing close resemblance to those on
the Bayeux tapestry.&nbsp; On the east side of the oratory is a
curious altar-piece in five compartments, representing the
Trinity, St. Catherine, St. Christopher, St. Michael and the
Dragon, and another figure too much mutilated to be
recognized.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>We confess ourselves indebted for these details, to more
erudite and heroic adventurers in the voyage of discovery among
these ruins than ourselves, the inaccessible looking archway of
the oratory high upon the wall, to be attained only by crossing a
plank from a tier of cells opposite, offering little temptation
to us to ascertain for ourselves the accuracy of statements made
by learned authorities, whose researches we presume neither to
question nor emulate.&nbsp; We do not venture to trespass on
paths so much more ably trodden; what pleases or strikes the eye
of the simple observer, we may note, perhaps often deriving
sensations of pleasure from objects that may offend the
cultivated taste of the connoisseur, but as we plead ignorance,
we trust to meet with indulgence.&nbsp; Associations, rather than
details of outline, cluster round our minds in visiting these
scenes, and on them we dwell.</p>
<p>The kitchens and dormitories were also on this floor, the
former accessible by a long narrow passage in the north wall,
from the spiral stairs in the north-east angle.</p>
<p>The next floor was occupied by the state apartments; and on
the exterior of the west side are four large windows with central
columns, opposite to corresponding openings in the inner wall for
the admission of light into the interior.&nbsp; The gallery on
this side contains three little recesses, or chambers, <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>as
they would have us call them, benched on either side, and
probably intended as waiting-rooms for the attendants.&nbsp; It
communicated with the south-west flight of stairs, but although
these yet remain, they are not safe to be explored.</p>
<p>The gallery on the north side has similar windows, and is
reached by the north-east staircase, with which the kitchen
gallery communicates; the passage is vaulted, and the tracings of
large archways, in the inner wall, filled in by masonry, have led
to the idea that a large banqueting chamber traversed this side
of the building, the entrance to which would be immediately
connected with the grand entrance from the tower.&nbsp; Another
gallery, somewhat similar, runs along the south wall, not now
accessible.&nbsp; These three galleries are all that remain
entire of the original apartments, the various archways and
outlines in the walls, rather suggesting than deciding questions
concerning the arrangement of the interior filling up.</p>
<p>Having finished our explorings among these hollow portions of
the walls, the winding stairs lead on to the giddy heights of the
ramparts, where a scene awaits the adventurer&rsquo;s eye, that
may well repay a steady effort to conquer the propensity to walk
over the unprotected side towards the court within.&nbsp; And
here we pause to take a survey of the picture as it lies out
before us; houses, slated, tiled, <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>thatched and
leaded, with their forests of chimneypots, the growth and
accumulations of centuries; high pinnacles of brick, sending
forth their volumes of smoke from huge factories, telling their
tales of human skill and genius triumphing over the powers of
earth, air, and water, bringing into subjection the sinews of
rock and veins of ore, and training them, by the aid of invisible
and subtle fluids, to yield obedience to the will of man, and
minister to the wants and luxuries of his being; windmills
spreading out their giant arms to stay the very winds of heaven
in their path till they have done their work; waters checked in
their onward course till their rebellious force has been turned
to profit; all speak of matter visible and invisible, made
subject to spirit power, and ministering to the will and wants of
man.&nbsp; Tales, too, of human toil and suffering, of wasting
labour, spent in the service of luxury and indolence, burthen the
air breathed forth from groaning engine-houses, and rising up
from hidden nests of poverty that lie sheltered beneath the eaves
of rich men&rsquo;s habitations, whose fair frontings to modern
streets or road-ways, too often form but outer coatings of
decency to masses of corruption hidden away in close yards,
courts, and alleys, at their back&mdash;church towers, and
spires, and turrets in manifold variety and abundance; and
prominent among the host, stands out in all the glory of hale
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>old age, fine old St Peter&rsquo;s, looking down from
his proud eminence in solemn dignity, and smiling at all the
feeble efforts of the mushrooms clinging to his very base to hide
his fair proportions; far and wide may we look to find his peer,
even among such gems of beauty as the patron saints so lavishly
have scattered among the lanes and thoroughfares of this very
garden of churches.&nbsp; Such are the city features of the
panoramic see; turning to another point of view, away, beyond the
foreground of the sheep and cattle pens that bespeak the
conversion of the ancient inner ballium into a modern
market-place for live stock, and across the deep running channel
laden with crafts not yet wholly superseded in their labours by
steam&mdash;that infant Hercules, whose leading-strings are
compassing the surface of the globe&mdash;we catch a glance of
the hanging woods of the fairest village our Norfolk scenery may
boast, whose Richmond-like gardens skirting the pathway of the
winding river, and meadow lands beyond, dotted here and there by
the alder cars that once gave a name to the Benedictine convent
close by, form a landscape of mingled animation and quiet rural
beauty, not often to be equalled in the suburbs of a
manufacturing city.&nbsp; No marvel why gala spots for
pleasure-loving citizens should be found interspersed among the
more refined parterres of the wealthy upon the shores; no marvel
that a summer&rsquo;s <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>evening should witness crowds of
holiday-seeking folks, thronging to taste the sweets of fresh
air, and rest from labour, in the midst of so fair a scene.</p>
<p>No marvel that a water frolic becomes dignified into a regatta
there, that for once, within the circuit of the year, the great
and small, the proud and humble, rich and poor, can mingle, to
look together upon a common object of amusement&mdash;that
fashion and poverty can meet in the field of pleasure&mdash;St.
Giles and St. James acknowledge the existence, nor frown at the
presence of each other.&nbsp; And who does not rejoice in the
festivity, almost the sole remnant of national sport left us in
this iron-working age?&nbsp; Who that can spare an hour from the
counter or the loom, or desk&mdash;from scribbling
six-and-eight-penny opinions, or scratching hieroglyphical
prescriptions for <i>aqua pura</i> draughts, does not contrive to
find some mode of transit by earth, air, or water to the scene of
mirth.&nbsp; Even a soaking shower is unavailing to damp the
ardour of the multitude, and not unseldom lends fresh stimulus to
fun and laughter among the merry-hearted denizens of smoke-dried
city streets and lanes.&nbsp; But we must not linger in their
midst&mdash;the gay pleasure-boats, with their shining sails,
tacking and bending to the breeze, the swift skullers in the gay
uniforms, the eager faces that line the course, the signal guns
and flags of victory, the music, and the mirth&mdash;all tell
that the <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>spirit of enjoyment is not yet quite
gone out from among us.&nbsp; We must now pass to other, and far
different objects, and from the present, travel back to the past,
whose page of history unfolds itself in the nearer object that
meets our eye, the whitened sides of the &ldquo;Lollard&rsquo;s
pit,&rdquo; where martyrs of old poured forth their dying
prayers; and yielded up their bodies to be burned as witness of
their faith&mdash;where Bilney listened to the words of his
murderers, beseeching him to release them before the people from
all blame, that they might not suffer loss of popularity or
alms&mdash;and where he turned and said: &ldquo;I pray you, good
people, be never worse to these men for my sake, as though they
should be the authors of my death.&nbsp; It is not
they;&rdquo;&mdash;then was bound to the stake and slowly burned,
in the presence of the multitudes that clothed the natural
amphitheatre around.&nbsp; The heights above are crowned by the
ruins of the old priory of St. Leonards, on the one side, and on
the other by a few fragments of St. Michael&rsquo;s chapel, whose
vestiges, under a name assigned to them through their later
notoriety, as the stronghold of the rebel Kett, yet linger as
landmarks on the early pathway of national progress and
reform.</p>
<p>There sat the &ldquo;King of Norfolk,&rdquo; as he was styled,
and held his councils of state under the old oak, which bore
thenceforth the title of the &ldquo;oak of <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the
Reformation;&rdquo;&mdash;there morning and evening service were
daily read to the rebel forces, and the Litany and Te Deum were
listened to with solemn earnestness.&nbsp; There Parker, the
future archbishop of Canterbury, ventured into the midst of the
rebel camp, and, under the shade of the oak, sent forth the voice
of exhortation to the discontented, but to little effect.&nbsp;
Enclosed lands, commons stolen from the public, and other
grievances suffered by the poor from the hands of the rich, lay
at the hearts of the people, and the prelate&rsquo;s errand of
peace had well nigh terminated ill, but for the power of
music&mdash;the solemn Te Deum burst forth from the voice of the
rebel&rsquo;s chaplain, and swelled by many &ldquo;singing
voices&rdquo; into a loud strain of sweet harmony, fell upon the
ear of the multitude, like oil upon the raging waters, and by its
sweetness shed peace for the time on all around.&nbsp; In this
rebellion fell the gallant Earl of Sheffield, in his zeal to aid
the efforts of the Earl of Warwick to quell the outburst of the
people&rsquo;s will; while beside him figured Dudley, the hero of
Kenilworth, and cruel husband of the hapless Amy Robsart.&nbsp;
The popular prophecy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The country gnoffes, Hob, Dick, and Hick,<br />
With clubs and clouted shoon,<br />
Shall fill the vale of Duffendale<br />
With slaughtered bodies soon&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was fulfilled, and besiegers and besieged were among <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the
victims.&nbsp; That there is no war like civil war was verified;
the wounded plucked the arrows from their wounds, that they might
be sent back dripping with their blood to the hearts of their
kinsmen and foes.&nbsp; The watchword, &ldquo;Gentlemen ruled
aforetime, a number will rule now another while,&rdquo; testified
to the turning of the worm when trodden on&mdash;evidencing the
ripening germ of the same spirit that had in earlier times wrung
from the tyrant monarch a &ldquo;Magna Charta,&rdquo; and will
yet, by agencies far other than arrow, spear, or sword, obtain
for an independent people, who can reverence the laws of order
and of right, every charter that shall be needed to gain them
their due place in the pillar of the state, where neither capitol
nor column can bear its own weight, without a base of solid and
fair proportions, to give harmony, strength, and beauty to the
whole.</p>
<p>Among the aggravating causes that led to this insurrection, so
famous in our country&rsquo;s annals, the desecration of church
furniture and vestments, that had followed the footsteps of the
Reformation, stood prominently forth; the people&rsquo;s hearts
rebelled against the havoc made amongst the objects they had been
taught to look upon as holy&mdash;and as these deeds of licence
had been simultaneous with encroachments upon their temporal
rights of pasture and common land, a double feeling was
engendered&mdash;a longing for social and political freedom, and
a <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>desire to reform a Reformation that was marked by such
atrocious want of reverence for all that had been sacred.&nbsp;
Conservatism and ultra-radicalism were blended, even as in many
minds to this hour they grow together.&nbsp; Connected with this
event of history, are two memorials that mark it as of national
interest&mdash;the Homily on Rebellion which was written against
the insurgents, and the institution of lord lieutenants of
counties, as safeguards against such another sudden and
formidable outbreak in any part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Stretching away far as the eye may reach, is the broad moor,
laid bare of forest trees by these same rebel forces, now clothed
with yellow furze and purple heather, intertwined with clovewort
and ranunculus, and hiding beneath, the crimson-tipped lichen,
whose sanguine clubs and cups would seem to have drank from the
soil the blood of the slain, and rendered it immortal.&nbsp;
Bowl-shaped excavations dotted over its surface, testify of
Celtic habitations hollowed out in remote ages, beneath the
forest shades, roofed by its boughs, and lying hidden among the
leaves like lower birds&rsquo; nests,&mdash;now in barren
desolation, serving well the vagrant purposes of gypsy life, and
lending a feature to the scene that Lavengro has painted with a
master-hand.</p>
<p>And now the eye reposes from its survey&mdash;and thought
flies back to the day when the distant sea <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>swept around
the base of the castle of Blanchflower, and filled the valley
below&mdash;to the era of the brave Iceni, and the sorrows of the
warrior queen, Boadicea&mdash;to the advent of the mighty
C&aelig;sar,&mdash;the appropriating Saxons,&mdash;and the savage
Danes and Norsemen, with their pirate hordes, storming the
outposts of the military camp from their uncouth naval
fleets,&mdash;and thence to the era of the Norman hero planting
his foot upon our soil, when barons multiplied in the land; and
one scene of history enacted within the castle walls, bearing
this date, tells much of feudal laws and feudal power.</p>
<p>The earldom of the city, castle, and meadow lands, being then
possessed by a Breton, named Ralph de Gael, or Guader, partly by
gift from the Conqueror, partly perhaps by force of arms, this
local sovereign designed to wed the daughter of one Fitz-Osborn,
a relation of William.</p>
<p>This matrimonial scheme not pleasing his lord the king,
without ceremony it was prohibited; but in that day of might
<i>versus</i> might, earls and barons would sometimes have a will
of their own, and the fair affianced was made a bride within the
chapel walls, whose doorway in an angle, marks the site of the
act of disobedience; the banquetting room then received the
bridal guests, and the sumptuous feast, with its attendant
libations, witnessed a yet more decided scene of rebellion; the
bridegroom and the <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>bride&rsquo;s own brother, the Earl
of Hereford, already committed by carrying the forbidden marriage
into effect, became eloquent and bold in their language and
designs, until a chorus of excited voices joined them in oaths
that sealed them as conspirators against their absent
sovereign.&nbsp; Treachery revealed the plot, and the church lent
its aid to the crown to crush the rebels.&nbsp; Lanfranc, the
primate and archbishop, sent out troops, headed by bishops and
justiciaries, the highest dignitaries of church and law, to
oppose and besiege them; the bridegroom fled for succour to his
native Brittany, leaving his bride for three months to defend the
garrison with her followers, at the end of which time the brave
Emma was compelled to capitulate, but upon mild terms, obtaining
leave for herself and followers to flee to Brittany; her husband
thenceforth became an outlaw&mdash;her brother was slain, and
scarcely one guest present at that ill-fated marriage feast
escaped an untimely end.&nbsp; Each prisoner lost a right foot,
many their eyes, and all their worldly goods.&nbsp; A sorrowful
romance of real life, to mark the early history of our castle
halls.</p>
<p>Nor did the city go unscathed, the devastation carried into
its midst by the siege was heavy; many houses were burnt, many
deserted by those who had joined the earl, and it is curious to
read in the valuation of land and property that was taken soon
after this event, how many houses are recorded as
&ldquo;<i>void</i>&rdquo; both in the burgh or that part of the
city <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>under the jurisdiction of the king and earl, as well as
in other portions subject to other lords, for it would seem that
the landlords of the soil on which stood the city were three, the
king or earl of the castle, the bishop, and the Harold family,
relatives of him who fell at Hastings.&nbsp; Clusters of huts
then congregated round the base of the hill and constituted the
feudal village; its inhabitants consisting of villains, of which
there were two classes, the husbandmen or peasants annexed to the
manor or land, and a lower rank described in English law as
villains-in-gross, in simple terms, absolute slaves, transferable
by deed from one owner to another, whose lives, save for the
ameliorations of individual indulgences, were a continued
helpless state of toil, degradation and suffering; the socmen or
tenants holding land by some <i>service</i>, (not knightly) and
bordars or boors, who occupied a position somewhat above the
serfs or villains, and held small portions of land with cottages
or <i>bords</i> on them, on condition they should supply the lord
with poultry, eggs, and other small provisions for his board and
entertainment.</p>
<p>Freemen seem to have included all ranks of society holding in
military tenure; they lived under the protection of great men,
but in their persons were free; the rural labourers were divided
into ploughmen, shepherds, neat-herds, cow-herds, swine-herds,
and bee-keepers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;haiae&rdquo; belonging to the
manor <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>houses were enclosed places, hedged
or paled round, into which beasts were driven to be caught.&nbsp;
At the time of the survey in William&rsquo;s reign the estimate
of the tenants and fiefs of the earl and king is taken as one
thousand five hundred and sixty-five burgesses, Englishmen paying
custom to the king, one hundred and ninety mansions void, and
four hundred and eighty <i>bordars</i>; the bishop&rsquo;s
territory contained thirty-seven burgesses, and seven mansions
void; and on the property of the deceased Harold, there were
fifteen burgesses and seven mansions void.</p>
<p>After the banishment of Earl Ralph, the castle was given to
Ralph Bigod, who was styled the Constable, as was usual when any
castle was committed to a baron or earl, and he exercised royal
power within the jurisdiction of the castle.&nbsp; To him
succeeded Roger Bigod, a great favourite and friend of Henry I.,
and one of the witnesses to the laws made by him during his
reign.&nbsp; William, the son of Roger, succeeded his father, and
by King Henry was made steward of his household.&nbsp; This
William was drowned at sea, and his brother Hugh became possessed
of his estate and honours.&nbsp; To him is referred the finishing
and beautifying of the tower of the castle; but he was supplanted
in the office of constable by William de Blois, Earl of Moreton,
son of King Stephen.&nbsp; He in his turn was dispossessed of it
by Henry II.&nbsp; Hugh Bigod joined with the son of Henry,
afterwards <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Henry III., in his revolt against his
father, for which adherence he was reinstated in the Castle of
Blancheflower, but was obliged again to surrender when the son
repented of his rebellion, and submitted to his father.</p>
<p>To Hugh succeeded another Roger Bigod, his son, who received
from the hands of Richard I. the earldom of Norfolk and
stewardship of the king&rsquo;s household, and most probably was
constable of the castle also.&nbsp; During the troubled reign of
John, it passed into the hands of Lewis, son of the French king,
who made William de Bellomont, his marshal, constable, and placed
him with a garrison within its walls.&nbsp; To him succeeded
Roger Bigod, who figured amongst the revolting barons in the
reign of Henry III.&nbsp; At the memorable interview between the
confederated nobles and the king, at the parliament in
Westminster, he took a leading part in the proceedings.&nbsp; All
the barons having assembled in complete armour, as the king
entered, there is described to have been a rattling of swords;
his eye gleaming along the mailed ranks he asked, &ldquo;What
means this?&nbsp; Am I a prisoner?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
so,&rdquo; replied Roger Bigod, &ldquo;but your foreign
favourites and your own extravagance have involved this realm in
great wretchedness, whereof we demand that the powers of
government be made over to a committee of bishops and barons,
that the same may root up abuses <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and enact
good laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; The committee when formed numbered in its
list both Roger of Norfolk earl marshal, and Hugh Bigod.&nbsp; In
this reign it is mentioned that the castle became a gaol for the
county, and state prisoners were confined here.&nbsp; Many a dark
tragedy was doubtless witnessed by its dungeon walls during those
troubled times, when civil wars were hourly peopling them with
political offenders.&nbsp; In Edward II.&rsquo;s reign the castle
was partly re-fortified, but in the following reign, falling
completely out of repair, it came to be regarded simply as a
county jail, and its jurisdiction vested in the hands of the
sheriff of the county.</p>
<p>Among the historical facts of later date, connected with the
castle, and bearing date of the same year as that in which Queen
Elizabeth visited the city, is an order issued from Whitehall, to
the sheriff of Norfolk, to imprison within the castle walls
certain persons who refused to attend the service of the church;
the letter is preserved among Cole&rsquo;s manuscripts in the
British Museum; the copy of it which is published by the
Arch&aelig;ological Society, runs thus:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To our loving Friend
Mr. Gawdry, Sherif of the Countie of Norfolk.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In 1643 an order was sent to fortify the castle, at the
request of the deputy lieutenant of the county; the order is
signed by seven staunch and influential opponents of the royal
party, viz. Tho. Wodehouse, John Palgrave, Tho. Hoggan, Miles
Hobart, J. Spelman, Tho. Sotherton, Gre. Gawsett.</p>
<p>Information concerning it from this period is scanty, probably
little of interest is connected with its later history, beyond
the calendar of prisoners who have been lodged within its
precincts, of which we have no record, and were it otherwise, we
should be reluctant to consult its pages for materials to enhance
the attractions of our &ldquo;Rambles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to the history of the period prior to its appropriation
as a prison, that we must look for a picture of the life once
animating its halls and banquet <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>chambers, and
from the general outlines of feudal society and government, a
tolerably faithful portrait of it may be drawn.</p>
<p>The age of feudalism has been extolled with enthusiasm only
equal to that which has deprecated it beyond measure; it has even
been proposed as a model for future ages by the cotemporary voice
to that which has pronounced it as exclusively a time of
immorality, despotism, and superstition; between the two
extremes, a wide field of truth lies open to be explored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a time,&rdquo; as Guizot says, &ldquo;when
religion was the principle and end of all institutions, while
military functions were the forms and means of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All social movements partook of this twofold character, as
questions of commerce and industry were decidedly
subordinate.</p>
<p>The land was divided between the military barons possessed of
regal authority and governing as kings in their petty
kingdoms&mdash;the church, also proprietors of large estates, and
the cities, then only beginning to rise from their abject nullity
into an importance that has gone on increasing until commerce has
become the sovereign of the world&mdash;Mammon its god.&nbsp; The
individualism of barbarism was sunk in the centralisation to
which this system gave birth; and from the social arrangements
connected with it, <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>sprung up that spirit of chivalry
that was so marked a characteristic of the times, than which
nothing more fully exemplified the singular combination of
military and religious fervour.&nbsp; Isolated from all communion
with general society, a castle was at once a city and a family in
itself, youths were apprenticed, as it were, to learn the usages
of knighthood, and in the capacity of pages, from earliest
boyhood, were initiated into the forms and courtesies of
chivalrous and military exercises.&nbsp; In this task women bore
their part, the youths being ever treated as sons of the lord or
knight under whose tutelage they had been placed; from this they
became promoted to the rank of esquires, and perfected in the
arts of tilting, riding, hunting, and hawking, frequently of
music, and in case of war were qualified to follow the banner of
their instructors.&nbsp; The rank or military renown of a baron
helped to swell the list of esquires and pages in his retinue;
hence many castles were complete colleges of chivalry.&nbsp; The
close association of years in such familiar relationship cut off
from all other social communion, engendered strong attachments,
and fraternities, superseding often the ties of common
relationship, sprung up.</p>
<p>The imposing ceremony that accompanied the distinction of
knighthood was the finishing touch to this education.&nbsp; The
candidate, after several lonely nights of prayer and watching in
some church or <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>chapel, during which period he
received the sacraments of religion, was finally arrayed in full
splendour, conducted in grand procession to a church with the
sword of knighthood suspended by a scarf; the weapon was blessed
by an officiating priest, and the oaths administered which bound
him to defend the church and clergy, be the champion of virtuous
women, especially the widow or orphan, and to be gentle ever to
the weak.&nbsp; Warriors then of high degree, or ladies, then
buckled on the spurs, clothed him in suits of armour, and the
prince or noble from whom he received the knighthood, finally
advanced, and giving the accolade, which consisted of three
gentle strokes with the flat of the sword, exclaimed, &ldquo;In
the name of God, St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a
knight; be hardy, brave, and royal.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this date
he might aspire to the highest offices and distinctions.</p>
<p>The domestic comforts that graced the private life within
these castle halls, formed striking contrasts to the magnificence
of the knightly and military displays, although the walls often
were hung with gorgeous tapestries, and the banqueting table
groaned beneath the weight of gold and silver, the refinements
essential to modern ideas of comfort were unknown.&nbsp; The
fingers of the eater supplied the place of forks, and when
withdrawn from rich dishes, were often employed in tearing the
morsels of food <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>asunder.&nbsp; Straw and rushes were
the substitutes for carpets, and clumsy wooden benches and tables
supported the guests and viands at these entertainments; those
who were unfortunate enough not to obtain a seat at the board
were compelled to make use of the floor.&nbsp; Several English
estates were held upon condition of furnishing straw for royal
beds, and litter for the apartment floors of a palace; and the
office of rush strewer remained in the list of the royal
household to a very late period.&nbsp; Doubtless these
deficiences were of slight importance to an active out-door
people, whose happiness consisted in large retinues, rich
armours, and splendid tournaments; even the ladies, with hunting,
hawking, and the occasional amusement of displaying their skill
in archery from the loop-holes or ramparts of their castles, when
acting as viceroys for their sovereign lords, no doubt could well
dispense with the minor occupations of refined civilization.</p>
<p>The bill of fare of a feudal banquet would possibly astonish
and puzzle the gastronomic powers and digestive organs of the
nineteenth century, although cookery was esteemed as a noble
science even then, in the days when Soyer was not.&nbsp; The
boar&rsquo;s head, the peacock, occasionally served up in his
feathers, the crane or young herons, might not have been
altogether bad substitutes for turkeys and geese, but whether
larded, roasted, and eaten with ginger, and <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>often served
in their feathers, they might have been suited to our modern
tastes is problematical; porpoises and seals that often appeared
in the list of &ldquo;goodly provisions&rdquo; for special
occasions, may scarcely be deemed more of dainties; and the
compounds that figure in some of the recipes extant, of the more
mystical entr&eacute;es, present to the eye such medleys, that we
feel certain of a preference for the plain &ldquo;roast&rdquo; or
&ldquo;boil,&rdquo; in feudal times, at least, if not at all
others.&nbsp; Force-meats, compounded of pork, figs, cheese, and
ale, seasoned with pepper, saffron, and salt, baked in a crust,
and garnished with powderings of sugar and comforts, may be
quoted as a sample of their made dishes, while beef-tea, enriched
with pork fat, beaten up with cream and sweetened with honey, as
directed by their form, possibly was classed among the delicate
soups, or ranged under the head of &ldquo;<i>sick
cookery</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bread that formed the substitute for our best and
&ldquo;second households,&rdquo; was of various kinds, the finest
being a sort of spice-cake of superior quality; simnel and wastel
cakes were the ordinary food for the aristocracy, while commoners
were content with a coarse brown material manufactured from rye,
oats, or barley, that would at this day cause a revolution in
prisons, or pauper workhouses, were it to be found in the dietary
table of either, much less on the dinner-table.&nbsp; The special
wines, hippocras, <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>pigment, morat, and mead, were the
temptations to inebriety among the rich; cider, perry, and ale,
the form of alcoholic drinks common to the less affluent.</p>
<p>The record of Peter de Blois, in one of his letters from the
Court of Henry II., may be estimated perhaps as a faithful, if
not attractive, description of the ordinary fare on which many
unfortunate knights and retainers were sometimes compelled to
subsist.&nbsp; He tells us that a priest or soldier had bread put
before him, &ldquo;not kneaded, not leavened, made of the dregs
of beer, like lead, full of bran, and unbaked, wine spoiled by
being sour or mouldy, thick, greasy, rancied, tasting of pitch,
and vapid, sometimes so full of dregs, that they were compelled
rather to filter than drink it, with eyes shut and teeth closed;
meat stale as often as fresh; fish often four days
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; The picture is heightened by sundry details of
a pungent character, all tending to prove the truth of his
assertion, that powerful exercise was an essential assistant to
overcome the evils of such diet.&nbsp; Early hours possibly
contributed to lessen its injurious effects; and these of course,
at any rate as far as regarded the &ldquo;early to bed,&rdquo;
were enforced by the curfew, which has so mistakenly been
attributed to the Norman Conqueror&rsquo;s despotism, whereas it
had long prevailed as a custom here, as on the continent, prior
to his era, and was, in fact, a necessary precaution against the
dangers of fire, <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>when the dwelling-houses that formed
a town or city were little more than bundles of faggots, well
dried and bound up ready for burning.</p>
<p>Among the social amusements of that time, gambling seems to
have prevailed to a great extent.&nbsp; The curious prohibitions
that were enacted in the reign of Richard, would indicate that it
had then grown into a formidable vice; kings were permitted to
play with each other, and command their followers, but the nobles
were restricted to losing twenty shillings in one night; priests
and knights might, with permission, play to the same amount, but
were to forfeit four times twenty shillings if they exceeded it;
servants might also play to a limited extent, at the
<i>command</i> of their master, but if they ventured without such
permission, they subjected themselves to the penalty of being
whipped three successive days; and mariners at sea, for a like
transgression, were sentenced to be ducked three times for the
offence.&nbsp; Chess, that infinite and insoluble intellectual
problem, whose origin is lost in oriental obscurity, was
introduced by the Crusaders on their return from their
expeditions to the Holy Land, if, indeed, as some believe, it was
not known in this country prior to that date; but if we may judge
by inference, we may presume it to have been no favourite
recreation in those spirit-stirring times, when crusades,
tournaments, and military prowess <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>were the end
and aim of men&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; The amusements and sports
naturally partook of the character of the age, and hunting,
hawking, tilting, and tournaments were at once the schools for
gaining strength and dexterity, as well as safety-valves for the
overflowing mobility engendered by the spirit of the times.&nbsp;
These pursuits were elevated to the rank of perfect sciences, and
the education of a youth was incomplete that did not embrace
regular tuition in all of them.&nbsp; Nor were they, as we know,
confined to the &ldquo;lords of the creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
hunting, ladies not only often joined in the sport, but
frequently formed parties by themselves, winding the horn,
rousing the game, and pursuing it without assistance, the female
Nimrods manifesting especial partiality to greyhounds&mdash;or
hare-hounds, as they were then called.&nbsp; The objects of these
hunts were somewhat more numerous and varied then than now, and
were divided into three classes; first, the beasts for hunting,
viz. the hare, the hart, the wolf, and the wild boar; secondly,
the beasts of the chase, the buck and doe, the fox, the martin,
and the roe; and a minor class, which were said to afford great
disport in the pursuit, the <i>grey</i>, or badger, the wild cat,
and the otter.</p>
<p>The poor little hare and a fox or two, alone are left us of
all these original tenants of the soil; and game laws were, even
in those days of plentiful <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>supply, found
needful to preserve the aborigines of the woods as their especial
property, by the great ones of the land, and when manslaughter
was to be atoned for by a fine of money, the death of a head of
deer was punishable by the forfeiture of the offender&rsquo;s
eyes, and a second instance by death.&nbsp; Who will dispute the
aristocratic lineage of the game laws, with such facts of history
before them?&nbsp; Hunting had its proper seasons; the wolf and
fox might be hunted from Christmas-day to the Annunciation, the
roebuck from Easter to Michaelmas, the roe from Michaelmas to
Candlemas, the hare from Michaelmas to Midsummer, the boar from
the Nativity to the day of the &ldquo;Presentation in the
Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergy were not behind-hand in partaking of the privileges
of the chase within their own demesnes, and they took care
generally to have good receptacles for game in their parks and
enclosures.&nbsp; At the time of the Reformation, the see of
Norwich had no less than thirteen parks well stocked with deer;
and the name of one of the city churches, St. Peter&rsquo;s,
Hungate, is derived from the <i>Hound&rsquo;s</i>-gate, where the
bishop&rsquo;s hounds were stabled.</p>
<p>Hawking was a sport, until the magna charta, exclusively
confined to the nobility; lords and ladies alike indulged
themselves in the exercise, which from its gentleness, in
comparison with others then in vogue, was deemed somewhat an
effeminate pastime, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>probably because, in the delicate
dexterity it required, the ladies bore off the palm of
victory.</p>
<p>A hawk&rsquo;s eyrie was returned in doomsday-book as one of
the most valuable articles of property; and the estimation in
which the bird was held, may be judged of by the enormous prices
given for them, and the heavy penalties attached to stealing
either them or their eggs; for destroying one of which the
offender was liable to imprisonment for a twelvemonth and a
day.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, this is no very safe criterion of
their intrinsic value, or those sentences that sometimes figure
in our modern assize reports&mdash;where seven years&rsquo;
transportation for stealing two ducks from an open pond, stands
side by side with twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment for murdering
a wife, a friend, or a child, in a fit of temporary insanity,
alias intoxication&mdash;might lead to rather curious
inferences.</p>
<p>But to return to our hawks; a thousand pounds for a cast of
these birds, and a hundred marks for a single one, are recorded
prices.&nbsp; In hawking, the bird was carried on the wrist,
which was protected by a thick glove, the head of the bird
covered with a hood, and its feet secured to the wrist by straps
of leather, called jesses, and to its legs were fastened small
bells, toned according to the musical scale.</p>
<p>Among the chronicles of old monkish writers prior <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>to
the Conquest, is a story accounting for the first advent of the
Danes upon our shores, as connected with the amusement of
hawking: &ldquo;A Danish chieftain of high rank, named Lothbroc,
amusing himself with hawking near the sea, upon the western
shores of Denmark, the bird in pursuit of her game fell into the
water; Lothbroc, anxious for her safety, got into a little boat
that was near at hand, and rowed from the shore to take her up;
but before he could return to land, a sudden storm arose, and he
was driven out to sea.&nbsp; After suffering great hardships,
during a voyage of infinite peril, he reached the coast of
Norfolk, and landed at a port called Reedham, (now a small
village on the railway line from London to Yarmouth,) where he
was immediately seized by the inhabitants, and sent to the court
of Edmund, King of the East Angles, who received him favourably,
and soon became strongly attached to him for his skill in
training and flying hawks.&nbsp; The partiality shown to the
foreigner excited the jealousy of Beoric, the king&rsquo;s
falconer, who took an opportunity of murdering the Dane whilst he
was exercising his birds in a small wood, where he secreted the
body.&nbsp; The vigilance of a favourite spaniel discovered the
deed.&nbsp; Beoric was apprehended and convicted of the murder,
and condemned to be put in an open boat, without sails, oars, or
rudder, and abandoned to the mercy of <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the winds
and wares.&nbsp; It so chanced that the boat was wafted to the
very point of land that Lothbroc came from; and Beoric was
apprehended by the Danes, and taken before their two chieftains,
Hinguer and Hubba, the sons of Lothbroc, to whom the crafty
falconer made a statement as ingenious as false, wherein he
affirmed that their father had been murdered by Edmund, and
himself sent adrift for opposing the deed.&nbsp; Irritated by the
falsehood, the Danes invaded the kingdom of the East Angles,
pillaged their country, took their king prisoner, tied him to a
stake, and shot him to death with arrows.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lidgate, a monk of St. Edmund&rsquo;s at Bury, has given this
legend a place in his poetical life of the tutelary saint of his
monastery, but it bears upon it every mark of a legendary tale,
and the fact is well known that Danish pirates had infested the
shores long prior to the date assigned to the events narrated in
it.</p>
<p>The office of &ldquo;queen&rsquo;s falconer&rdquo; yet exists,
and it is written in a certain little black book, that the duties
attached to it, however imaginary, receive substantial
acknowledgement from the public purse in the form of an annual
stipend of no mean amount.&nbsp; Another recreation peculiarly
associated with the memory of knights and dames once tenanting
the feudal castle is the tournament, the site of whose gorgeous
pageantries yet bears the title of the &ldquo;Gilden
croft,&rdquo; <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>though the lustre of the name is the
only ray of splendour bequeathed to it as an inheritance of
glory.&nbsp; Centuries have witnessed the mutations of the
properties of the great ones of the land, as they have gradually
passed down through the various gradations of society like
cast-off garments, until the once brilliant lists of the gay
tournament have changed to long tiers of poverty tenanted
&ldquo;<i>right ups</i>;&rdquo; the music of the herald&rsquo;s
trumpet has been replaced by the rattle of the shuttle and the
loom; and the steel-clad knights and esquires, with their
tiltings and joustings, amid the smiles and favours of youth and
beauty, have given place to the struggles of the weaver and the
winder in their weary battle of life, for the guerdon of daily
bread.&nbsp; Where, Edward and Phillippa held their Easter
tournament, and their gallant son, the brave Black Prince,
displayed his knightly prowess amid splendours that might rival
the &ldquo;field of the cloth of gold,&rdquo; poverty, hard
labour, and penury now rear their gaunt limbs; and the tale of
the &ldquo;Paramatta weaver&rdquo; is breathed forth to the
listening ear of humanity from its precincts.</p>
<p>But the tournament demands attention, inwrought as it is with
every conception we may form of the days of chivalry; and, thanks
to the patient researches of many chroniclers, we have not much
difficulty in learning all we may desire to know concerning these
glories of an age gone by.&nbsp; Fiction has given <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>life and vigour to these features of past
history.&nbsp; Ivanhoe lives and breathes before us at the
mention of a tournament, and plain prose facts may not vie with
the glowing pictures, painted with imagination&rsquo;s rainbow
hues.&nbsp; The tournament was not altogether the play-ground of
full-grown knights and esquires, as romance would sometimes tend
to show it;&mdash;it was the theatre on which many an important
drama of life was played; it was a grand field for introduction
into military life, then the only life deemed worthy the ambition
of a gentleman; and the laws and regulations to which all who
presented themselves as candidates for honours became subject,
bespeak the importance attached to the favours it conferred.</p>
<p>The mode of conducting a tournament was established by
law.&nbsp; It was preceded always by a proclamation; one worded
thus, is given by Strutt: &ldquo;Be it known unto you, lords,
knights, and esquires, ladies and gentlewomen,&rdquo; (they did
not in those days of chivalry commence ladies, my lords and
gentlemen) &ldquo;you are hereby acquainted, that a superb
achievement in arms, and a grand and noble tournament, will be
held in the parade of Clarencieux king at arms, on the part of
the most noble baron, lord of I. C. B., and on the part of the
most noble baron the lord of C. B. D., in the parade of Norreys
king at arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; The regulations that follow are <!--
page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>these: &ldquo;The two barons on whose part the
tournament is undertaken shall be at their pavilions two days
before the commencement of the sports, when each of them shall
cause his arms to be attached to his pavilion, and set up his
banner in front of his parade; and all those who wish to be
combatants on either side, must in like manner set up their
banner on either side before the parade allotted to them.&nbsp;
Upon the evening of the same day, they shall shew themselves in
their stations, and expose their helmets to view at the windows
of their pavilions.&nbsp; On the morrow the champions shall be at
their parades by the hour of ten in the morning, to await the
commands of the lord of the parade, and the governor, who are the
speakers of the tournament; at this meeting the prizes of honour
are determined.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the document from which this is
taken, a rich sword was to be the reward of the most successful
on the part of Clarencieux, and a helmet for the best on the side
of Norreys.&nbsp; It goes on to say, &ldquo;On the morning of the
day appointed for the tournament, the arms, banners and helmets
of all the combatants shall be exposed at their stations, and the
speakers present at the place of combat by ten of the clock,
where they shall examine the arms and approve or reject them at
pleasure; the examination being finished and the arms returned to
the owners, the baron who is the challenger shall then cause his
banner <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>to be placed at the beginning of the
parade, and the blazon of his arms to be nailed to the roof of
his pavilion; his example is to be followed by the baron on the
opposite side, and all the knights of either party who are not in
their stations before the nailing up of the arms, shall forfeit
their privileges and not be permitted to tournay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king at arms and the heralds are then commanded by
the speakers to go from pavilion to pavilion crying aloud,
&lsquo;<i>To Achievement</i>, <i>knights and esquires</i>, <i>to
Achievement</i>,&rsquo; being the notice for them to arm
themselves; and soon after the company of heralds shall repeat
the former ceremony, having the same authority, saying,
&lsquo;<i>Come forth</i>, <i>knights and esquires</i>, <i>come
forth</i>;&rsquo; and when the two barons have taken their places
in the lists, each of them facing his own parade, the champions
on both parts shall arrange themselves, every one by the side of
his banner; and then two cords shall be stretched between them,
and remain in that position, until it shall please the speakers
to command the commencement of the sports.&nbsp; The combatants
shall each of them be armed with a pointless sword, having the
edges rebated, and with a truncheon hanging from their saddles,
and they may use either the one or the other, so long as the
speakers shall give them permission, by repeating the sentence,
&lsquo;<i>Let them go on</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; After they have
sufficiently performed their exercise, <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the
speakers are to call to the heralds, and order them to
&lsquo;<i>Fold up the banners</i>,&rsquo; which is the signal for
the conclusion of the tournament.&nbsp; The banners being rolled
up, the knights and esquires are permitted to return to their
dwellings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every knight or esquire performing in the tournament, was
permitted to have one page within the lists, (but without a
truncheon or any other defensive weapon,) to wait upon him, give
him his sword, or truncheon, as occasion might require; and also
in case of any accident happening to the armour, to repair
it.</p>
<p>The laws of the tournament permitted any knight to unhelm
himself at pleasure, if he was incommoded by the heat; none being
suffered to assault him in any way, until he had replaced his
helmet at the command of the speakers.</p>
<p>The king-at-arms and the heralds who proclaimed the
tournament, had the privilege of wearing the blazon of arms of
those by whom the sport was instituted; besides which, they were
entitled to six ells of scarlet cloth as their fee, and had all
their expenses defrayed during the continuance of the tournament;
by the law of arms they had a right to the helmet of every knight
when he made his first essay at a tournament; they also claimed
six crowns as nail money, for affixing the blazon of arms to the
pavilion.&nbsp; The king at arms held the banners of the <!--
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>two chief barons on the day of the tournament, and the
other heralds the banners of their confederates according to
their rank.</p>
<p>The lists for the tournaments and those appointed for ordeal
combats, were appointed in the same manner; the king found the
field to fight in, and the lists were made and devised by a
constable; they were to be sixty paces long and forty broad, set
up in good order, the ground within hard and level, without any
great stones or other impediments, the entrances to them to be by
two doors east and west, strongly barred with bars seven feet
high, that a horse may not leap them.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the tournament, the combatants retired
to their homes, but usually met again in the evening at some
entertainment; where they were joined by all the nobility,
including the ladies, and dancing, feasting and singing concluded
the day.&nbsp; After supper the speakers of the tournament called
together the heralds appointed on both sides, and demanded from
them alternately the names of those who had best performed on the
opposite sides; the double list was then presented to the ladies
who had been present at the pastime, and the decision was
referred to them as to the award of the prizes; they selected one
name from each party, and the successful heroes received their
prizes from the hands of two young maidens of rank.&nbsp; If a
knight transgressed <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the rules he was excluded from the
lists with a sound beating, from which alone the intercession of
ladies could save him; so the influence of the fair sex had
opportunities of being practically felt, as well as theoretically
talked of, even then.</p>
<p>The juste or lance game differed from the tournament and was
often included in it, when it took place at its conclusion, but
it was quite consistent with the rules of chivalry for justs to
be held separately; the sword was the weapon used at the
tournament, the lance at the juste.&nbsp; The juste received the
title of the &ldquo;Round table game,&rdquo; in the reign of
Henry III., from a fraternity of knights who frequently justed
together, and accustomed themselves to associate and eat together
in one apartment at a round table, where every place was equally
honourable (even in feudal times a taint of democracy would creep
in).&nbsp; Historians attribute this round table game to Arthur,
the son of Uter Pendragon, that famous British hero, whose
achievements are so disguised with legendary wonders that his
very existence has been questioned.</p>
<p>At both tilts and tournaments the lists were superbly
decorated, surrounded by the pavilions of the champions, and
ornamented with their coats and banners.&nbsp; The scaffolds for
the accommodation of the spectators were hung with tapestry, and
embroidered with gold and silver; all attended in their <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>most sumptuous apparel, and the display of costly
grandeur glittering over the whole surface of the field, might
well earn for the memorable scene so designated, its title of the
Gilden Croft.&nbsp; Wealth, beauty, and grandeur were
concentrated into one focus, whence they blazed forth to the eye
as from a burning lens.</p>
<p>The dress of the combatants varied according to the rank of
the individual.&nbsp; Above the under-dress of cloth, fitting
close, and common to all, was worn the <i>chausses</i>, or mail
coverings for the feet and legs, somewhat resembling metal
stockings; upon the body the gambeson, a sort of close jacket
made of cloth or leather doubled and stuffed, and in itself
oftentimes a most efficient case of defensive armour; this
garment, without sleeves, and universally worn by all classes of
men, was also occasionally introduced into the catalogue of
ladies&rsquo; attire, and no doubt was the primitive model for
the stays of later generations.&nbsp; Above the gambeson was worn
the <i>gorget</i> or throat piece, beneath the <i>hauberk</i> or
coat of mail, by which it was concealed; this was the garment
that peculiarly designated the rank of the wearer.&nbsp; Esquires
might not wear sleeves of mail, and none might claim to wear the
complete suit that were not possessed of certain estates.&nbsp;
Above the armour was usually worn some outer dress, a surcoat or
mantle of rich material.&nbsp; The sword belt was a necessary
part of the warrior&rsquo;s <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>dress, and
was often very elaborately embellished with precious stones, but
more commonly made simply of plain leather.&nbsp; Another belt
was also worn over the left shoulder, to support the shield.</p>
<p>The helmet comprised the whole armour for the head and face,
and usually consisted of two parts, one moving over the other, by
which means the face could be uncovered or perfectly inclosed at
pleasure.&nbsp; These portions of the dress, however, varied to
an almost infinite degree at various times, and at a later period
were exchanged for the Bacinet, Cervaliere, Coif de fer, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Gloves of mail were attached to the sleeves of the hauberk,
and were sometimes divided at the extremities for the
accommodation of the fingers and thumb, but not often.&nbsp; Such
was the military costume of the knight in armour, and the dress
of the spectators, both gentlemen and ladies, must not altogether
be left unnoticed.&nbsp; The tunic and rich surcoat above,
sometimes varied with a hooded mantle, and the robe a long
garment of the tunic kind, were the leading characteristics of
male attire; shoes with long points, cloth sandals, ornamented
with embroidery, girdles enriched with precious stones, gloves
and spurs completed the suit.</p>
<p>The ladies wore gowns, or upper tunics, or robes, with
surcoats varying much in length, sometimes being shorter than the
tunic, at others trailing on <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the ground,
with long loose sleeves, open beneath to the elbow, and falling
thence almost to the feet.&nbsp; Their mantles were made of the
richest materials, and copiously embellished with gold, silver,
and rich embroideries, sometimes decorated with fringes of gold,
varying in size almost as much as material.&nbsp; The wimple was
a head-dress, worn with or without an additional veil, usually
linen, but occasionally of silk, embroidered with gold.&nbsp; It
was a species of veil, covering the head but not the face, and
fastened underneath the chin, or at the top of the head, by a
circlet of gold.&nbsp; The hair was worn loose and flowing, often
without any covering, but frequently bound by a chaplet of
goldsmith&rsquo;s work and flowers, or of the latter only.&nbsp;
Boots and gloves were in the inventory of necessaries, but, alas
for comfort, stockings were rare, white, black, or blue.&nbsp;
With this faint sketch of an Anglo-Norman wardrobe, as it
furnished materials to add splendour to the glittering field of
sport, we bid farewell to the lists, not, however, without one
more word as to the honourable position awarded to the gentler
sex in the jousts, which were usually made in their especial
honour, and over which they presided as judges paramount; so that
it behoved every true knight to have a favourite fair one, who
was not only esteemed by him as the paragon of beauty and virtue,
but supplied to him often the place of a tutelary saint, to whom
he paid his <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>vows in the day of peril; for it was
then an established doctrine that &ldquo;love made valour
perfect, and incited heroes to great enterprizes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Alas! for the good old times of chivalry, when women were content
to make <i>great warriors</i>; but as she did her mission in that
day, so may she, in this sober life of mental tiltings, lend her
meed of influence to people the world with <i>great
men</i>.&nbsp; And so farewell to tournaments; verily they are of
the past, and their glitter dazzles our senses, in this
generation of moral <i>versus</i> physical force, when among the
number of the people&rsquo;s favourite heroes is the champion of
Universal Peace Societies.</p>
<p>But we must not leave our sketch of the life in a feudal
castle, without one glance at the feminine employments that
served to relieve the monotonous existence of the isolated dames
condemned to comparative solitude within its walls; nor are we
able to discover much, if any, variety in their
occupations.&nbsp; The embroidery frame, and an occasional
spindle and distaff, before the improvements in arts and science
had substituted factories and looms, were almost the only
resources allowed them; but these were inexhaustible, and the
many elaborate specimens of their skill that have survived the
casualties of a hundred generations, bear witness to the
indefatigable perseverance with which they were employed.&nbsp;
The garments of the clergy at this period were richly <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>embroidered, so much so, as to excite the admiration of
the pope, and induce him to issue a bull to the English priests,
enjoining them to procure him vestments equally gorgeous.&nbsp;
Many of these were the free-will offerings of the rich, and the
fruits of highborn ladies&rsquo; industry.&nbsp; Fringe-making of
gold and silver, worked upon lace without the aid of the needle,
was another species of occupation afforded them, and constituted
the Phrygian work often spoken of by old historians.&nbsp;
Cyprian work was a variety of embroidery, inasmuch as it was a
thin, transparent texture like gauze, named <i>cyprus</i>, worked
with gold.&nbsp; Cyprus was a term applied also to black crape,
then appropriated exclusively to widows&rsquo; mourning; possibly
this might have been the origin of &ldquo;wearing the
cypress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Embroidery was not alone confined to
ornaments of dress, or even clerical vestments; hangings for the
chambers, and pictures on almost every possible subject, were
produced from the needle.</p>
<p>The tapestry at Bayeux, in Normandy, attributed to Matilda,
the queen of the Conqueror, represents the history of Harold,
king of England, and William of Normandy, from the embassy of the
former to Duke William, at the command of Edward the Confessor,
to his final overthrow at Hastings.&nbsp; The ground of this work
is a white linen cloth or canvas, one foot eleven inches in
depth, and two hundred <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and twelve
in length.&nbsp; The figures are all in their proper colours, of
a style not unlike those of japan ware, having no pretence to
symmetry or proportion.&nbsp; It is preserved with great care in
the cathedral dedicated to Thomas &agrave; Becket, in Normandy,
and is annually exhibited for eight days, commencing on St.
John&rsquo;s day, and is called <i>Duke William&rsquo;s
toilette</i>.</p>
<p>It is, however, extremely questionable whether it was the work
of the royal lady,&mdash;many figures in it would indicate that
its manufacture was of more recent date&mdash;be it as it may, it
is a wondrous specimen of patient industry, and valuable for the
representation of manners and customs of the times traced upon
it.</p>
<p>Here we bid farewell to castle halls, to the ghosts of belted
knights and hooded dames, to spinning wheels and tapestries,
falcons, jennets, tournaments, and banquets, to the
border&rsquo;s bord upon the skirting of his lord&rsquo;s domain,
the serf&rsquo;s log hut, the cowherd&rsquo;s shed, and the
prisoner&rsquo;s dungeon,&mdash;the moat, once deep and flowing,
now dried up, and teeming with cultivated trees and shrubs, and
ornamental flowers, and sculptured figures,&mdash;we say adieu to
the past history, written on the flints and mortar of the
ramparts, that have braved the &ldquo;battle and the
breeze,&rdquo; for near a thousand years,&mdash;and leave the
soaring heights, whence we may look down upon the little city
world below as on a stage, whose scenes and <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>slips are
all laid bare beneath us in their skeleton machinery&mdash;dark
lanes and lumbering alleys crowded round, and shut in out of
sight, by facial frontings of glass, and brick, and
plaster.&nbsp; Churches and heaped-up churchyards, bursting their
walls with the accumulated corruption of centuries of
generations,&mdash;distant villages and village spires,&mdash;and
spots made sacred by the blood of hero-martyrs,&mdash;the winding
river, once the stormy sea-passage for Norsemen and Saxon
fleets&mdash;and take one final leave of the giant
mound,&mdash;whose origin, whether first reared in Celtic ages
far remote, a temple to the Sun, or a portion of the far-famed
Icknild Way, that crosses our island like a belt from south-west
to north-east, whether the architecture of Danes, Saxons, or
Normans, is alike full of history and of poetry, and the well
garnered store-house of many a rich and precious truth,&mdash;a
monument of the past, ever present to our eye, as a landmark by
which to measure the progress of our nation in religion, freedom,
and social happiness.</p>

<p>The old city, so rich in antiquarian remains, can boast but
slow progress in modern architectural developments; nor may it
vie with many a younger town in its contrivances for the comfort
and conveniences of those most useful members of
society&mdash;the market-folks.&nbsp; No Grainger has arisen, to
rear a monument to his own fame, and of his city&rsquo;s
prosperity, in the form of a shelter for this important class of
the town and country populace.&nbsp; May be, the picturesque
beauty of the Flemish scene, with its changeful canopy of
&ldquo;ethereal blue,&rdquo; or neutral tint, toned down at
whiles to hues of sombre gloom, beneath <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the heavy
shade of passing storms of hail and thunder, or more
steady-falling rain and snow, has made the philanthropists of
these reforming times conservatives all, on this one point, while
model cottages, baths and washhouses, almshouses for freemen, and
almost every other scheme ingenuity may devise to testify the
care and thought bestowed upon the public weal, are rising up
around.&nbsp; Let the cry of &ldquo;<i>Protection</i>&rdquo; once
again be raised, not for the &ldquo;distressed
agriculturist&rdquo; salesman, in his handsome corn exchange, but
in favour of the &ldquo;unprotected females&rdquo; that sit
unsheltered from the sun or storm, to vend the produce of the
poultry-yards, the dairy-house, and market-garden.</p>
<p>But though no Temple to Commerce of the larder has been
erected&mdash;a fact to be deplored in a utilitarian
sense&mdash;it can never be denied that the good old seat of
thriving trade can boast as fine a specimen of a genuine old
market-place as may well be found in this day of competition and
rivalry.&nbsp; Its motley assemblage of buildings, ranged round
the open square, of all styles and all ages, jostling against one
another, or here and there huddled together into all sorts of
inconceivable groups of varied and fantastic outline; the young
ones of to-day starting up with bold and saucy front, and verily
squeezing out from among them their quaint, old-fashioned,
gable-ended kinsfolk of older date, or sometimes creeping out, as
it <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>were, from beneath them, content with shewing a modern
face in some lower window, decked with all the new-fangled
conceits of the latest fashions, and allowing their ancestors
quiet resting-place aloft, where to moulder away into decay, are
a chronology of history in themselves.&nbsp; Now and then, the
fretted ironwork of some miniature parade, hanging midway in the
air, and clinging to the perpendicular of masonry above some new
plate-glassed and glittering front, suggests thoughts of marine
villas, moonlight and sea views, and all those pretty poetical
fancies associated with a lodging at some fashionable
watering-place, and one wonders how they ever came to be
transported thither, and for why?&nbsp; They that own them tell
us that they have their use, in the city, where the love of
pageantry is an heir-loom from generations long since passed away
whose birthright was to minister to the gorgeous magnificence of
fraternities and guilds, banquettings and processions, that read
like fairy tales in this sober nineteenth century; and we would
believe in their utility, were it no other than to afford a
bird&rsquo;s eye view of the busy scenes of homely traffic going
on upon a market day, amongst the accumulated heaps of provisions
for the daily wants of life.</p>
<p><i>The wants of life</i>!&nbsp; Who amongst us knows the
meaning of the words, the <i>reality</i> they hide?&nbsp; Who
that has numbered among the wants of life, the gold <!-- page
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>to
purchase luxury or ornament, place or power, the ways and means
to shine and glitter in the world, where men are prized by what
they <i>seem</i>, rather than what they are; the wherewith to pay
the idly accumulated debts, incurred through mean attempts to
cover the rags of poverty, or decent homely garments of honesty,
with tinsel mockeries of wealth&rsquo;s trappings?&nbsp; Who
amongst these knows aught of the meaning of the <i>wants of
life</i>?&nbsp; Ask him who has known <i>Hunger</i>, has been
face to face with want and starvation, has shared with loved and
loving ones, weak babes, and sick and helpless mothers, the task
of driving these unbidden guests away, has felt the gnawing pangs
of their demon power, while gazing upon plenty, upon the wealth
of food and sustenance displayed before his eyes!&nbsp; Is it not
more marvellous and strange, that such piles as a market displays
should ever be permitted to lie safe within the arrow-shot of
gaunt and wasting poverty, than that the annals of our police
reports should now and then record how poverty and crime
sometimes go hand in hand?</p>
<p>But to look more in detail at the picture offered on a summer
market-day.&nbsp; There to the left sit congregated together the
vendors of the far-famed staple produce of the country
farm-yards, sheltered from the heat by the artificial grove of
variegated umbrellas, serving, or attempting to serve, the double
purpose of protection from the sun in summer, and <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>the rain in winter and summer.&nbsp; The poultry
&ldquo;pads&rdquo; and butter-stalls are one.&nbsp; Turkeys, and
geese, and fowls, and sausages, and little round white cheeses,
share the baskets and benches with eggs and <i>pints</i> of
butter, in the land where that commodity is sold by <i>liquid</i>
measure, whose equivalent is somewhere near about 1lb. 3 oz.</p>
<p>There is a legend that one who sits here is the heroine of an
old tale, which goes to the effect that &ldquo;once upon a
time,&rdquo; when the inspector came his round to test the
weights of all the measured pints, the old lady was observed
slily to slip a half crown into the end of a certain pint, and
hand it forward to bear the scrutiny; a bystander, who watched
the trick, a moment after laid his finger on the identical pint
and begged to purchase it, resisting all evasion on the part of
the discomfited saleswoman, who, compelled to submit, turned out
eventually the &ldquo;biter bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thronging around this neighbourhood, and proffering their
services with most assiduous perseverance, are a host of most
amiable-looking porter women, liveried in white aprons and
sleeves, with a pair of huge peck baskets dangling on their
arms.&nbsp; Tumbling, and bumping, and jostling among them,
drowning their pleadings in a deafening chorus of discordant
cries, come the itinerant venders of small
wares&mdash;&ldquo;lucifers three boxes a penny,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cabbage-nets only a penny,&rdquo; &ldquo;reels of cotton
two for a penny,&rdquo; <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>little
dangling bunches of skewers, ranged in progressive order on queer
and mysteriously twisted holders, that seem designed to puzzle
any mechanical skill to get them off again, &ldquo;only a
penny;&rdquo; laces, and saucepans, and stationery, and kettles,
thrust into notice as though haberdashers, and tinmen, and
stationers were simultaneously rushing off to the gold diggings,
and disposing of their goods piecemeal by auction.&nbsp; Ere the
next range of stalls may be explored, the pathway is obstructed
by some &ldquo;literate&rdquo; specimen of the blind, with an
attendant concourse of listeners eagerly drinking in the titles
of his sheet of hundred songs for a penny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good time coming,&rdquo;
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s lost now,&rdquo; &ldquo;My bark is on the
shore,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the Sea,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.; or should any great tragedy or judicial murder have
occurred recently, to furnish him with a still more profitable
stock in trade, such as a &ldquo;last dying speech and
confession,&rdquo; or &ldquo;full, true, and particular
account&rdquo; of some &ldquo;shocking and brutal outrage,&rdquo;
somewhat may be seen and heard of how the minds and tastes of the
ignorant are vitiated, and the morbid cravings of diseased
imaginations fed; and the hawker of this food for the million,
forms living evidence that the eye is not the only member through
whose aid vice may gain entrance to the soul.&nbsp; But there is
little time or opportunity to philosophize amid the din of
importunity that is ringing upon <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the ears,
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye luke for? fine guse? butifull
fowill?&rdquo;&nbsp; And there stands one who claims especial
notice&mdash;the merry bacon woman, amid her throng of earnest
customers.&nbsp; There she stands, or rather moves; stillness is
a state to which she must be a total stranger, we could
fancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good day, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for you, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nice pork,
<i>dear</i>? black meat?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait <i>of ye</i> this
minute, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, beautiful ham;
did you please to want any?&nbsp; Oh, thank you; very well,
another day I shall be <i>proud</i> to wait <i>of
ye</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No harm in asking,&rdquo; she adds,
turning apologetically to her more profitable customers.&nbsp;
And so she goes on, ever moving, ever talking, ever cheerful,
civil, and attentive, one never-ending strain of courtesy and
kindness pouring from her lips, while her hands are ever busy
cutting and weighing, and folding up in fine white linen cloths,
her sausages and bacon, and black meat, and still nicer white
juvenile-looking pork, just fresh from the pickle.&nbsp; Probably
she has a home somewhere, but her sphere of usefulness and
theatre of glory must be at the market-stall; she must have been
born and bred a market-woman.&nbsp; Further on, there sits a
melancholy and original old lady, proprietress of a heterogeneous
kind of heap, composed of small quantities of the choicest
produce of various sources of supply&mdash;stray joints of pork,
trifling displays of butter, a few eggs, and an occasional
specimen of poultry; but her fame is <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>built upon
her unrivalled &ldquo;tatoes,&rdquo; hidden up in pads, and
carefully concealed from the eyes of chance passengers; their
discovery is a mine of wealth to the privileged few, especially
in bad seasons.&nbsp; Dealing forth sparingly, like a miser
counting out his treasures, the queen of murphies compensates for
the reserve that would seem to imply her belief that her
purchasers were begging favours of her, by the involuntary boon
she confers upon the lover of idioms, in her quaint displays of
her county&rsquo;s dialect.&nbsp; The ordinary greeting of
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; will be met by the assurance
that she &ldquo;don&rsquo;t <i>fare to feel</i> no
matters,&rdquo; or she &ldquo;<i>fares to</i> feel <i>right
muddled</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>no how</i>,&rdquo; or that she
is scarce fit to be &ldquo;abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her
&ldquo;tatoes&rdquo; she will recommend as eating like balls of
flour, if cooked <i>enow</i> (a word indiscriminately used to
express quantity and degree).&nbsp; She will occasionally detail
particulars of her market-horse&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>trickiness</i>&rdquo; when he
&ldquo;<i>imitated</i>&rdquo; to kick on the road, and how she
&ldquo;<i>gots</i>&rdquo; him on as well as she could.&nbsp; Her
breakfast jug she will designate a <i>gotch</i>, and many other
like specimens will she afford of the contents of the vocabulary
of East Anglia.&nbsp; A traveller may with little difficulty
fancy he is listening to some native of the distant county Devon;
and, strange to say, the <i>guse</i>, <i>fule</i>, and
<i>enow</i>, and other striking similarities of brogue and
dialect, are not the only features of resemblance these two
counties <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>bear to each other.&nbsp; The
ancient rood screens of the Norfolk churches have many of them
been found exactly to correspond with those found in Devonshire,
and only there.&nbsp; In the celebrated rebellions of Edward the
Sixth&rsquo;s reign, many remarkable features of resemblance were
observed in the character of the outbreaks at these distant
points,&mdash;so much so, as to suggest the idea of secret
communication being kept up between them.&nbsp; Whether both
alike owe their peculiarities to the common parentage of the
Iceni, a tribe of whom have been said to have settled in
Devonshire as well as Pembrokeshire, or they are referable to any
less remote link of connection, antiquarians may perhaps at some
future day make clear.&nbsp; Certain it is, the
&ldquo;southron&rdquo; is apt to be easily beguiled into the
belief that he has met a fellow-countryman or woman among the
folks who deem themselves another race than the people of the
&ldquo;<i>sheeres</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we have here wandered far aside in our market trip; next
come in due order the butcher-stalls, taking a higher rank in the
social scale of market society than the humbler <i>pads</i>,
though their wares may not compete with their neighbours for a
world-wide fame&mdash;south-down mutton, prime little scot, and
short-horn beef, with the usual attendant displays of
calves&rsquo; white heads with staring eyes, and mangled feet
hanging to dismembered legs and shoulders by little strings of
sinew, looking as though <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>they were
carelessly left on by accident, <i>not</i> to affect the weight,
and other mysterious manifestations of the internal anatomy of
oxen and sheep, and queer-looking conglomerations of odds and
ends, transmogrified by some cooking process into very greasy
imitations of brawn, and selling by the name of pork
cheeses,&mdash;these make up the attractions of the butcher
department, not over-inviting to look upon, even to those who are
far from objecting to well-disguised appeals to their carnivorous
propensities in the form of savoury dishes.</p>
<p>The lover of beauty will soon permit his eye to wander on and
rest upon the treasures of the market-garden, where it may revel
in a perfect sea of &ldquo;Bremer&rdquo; lusciousness;
asparagus&mdash;seakale&mdash;peas, marafats and
blues&mdash;beans, kidneys dwarfs, and windsor&mdash;salads and
cresses&mdash;radishes in radiating bunches and globular
bunches&mdash;cabbages and cauliflowers, that may perplex cooks
and boilers by their magnitude&mdash;cucumbers and melons, and
all the pumpkin tribe.&nbsp; Fruit&mdash;shining heaps of
cherries&mdash;trays of bright glistening currants, with their
little seeds peeping through as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; as the gems
in the great Russian cabinet&mdash;strawberries and raspberries
on their wooden trays, with the little skimmer-like spades to
shovel them up, and the choice ones packed up in their little
pints, sheltered from the sun by the fresh green leaf tied
over&mdash;and sundry <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and divers wares from foreign parts
lending new features to the home department, since the tariff of
the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s friend&rdquo; came into
operation.&nbsp; But the crowning glory of the picture is the
sovereign of the stall, the sturdy market-gardener, full of
strength and sinew, the evidence of honest healthful labour
meeting its due reward,&mdash;a fitting representative of the
great base upon whose soundness rests the column of wealth, and
capitol of rank, that with it form the pillar of our
nation&rsquo;s social prosperity.&nbsp; He knows not what it is
to seek for work, but rather needs to pluralise himself to
satisfy the demands upon his skill, and time, and taste; and
fairly has he earned his reputation both in horti and
floriculture.&nbsp; His rustic little home, with its thatched
roof, and ivy and clematis twined verandah, lies in the very
midst of a city of gardens almost of his own creation, watched
and tended by him with a care that has rendered them the fairest
line of beauty art ever devised to grace a road-side pathway
through the suburbs of a city; and who ever saw or tasted wares
that could rival the produce of his own little profitable
domain?&nbsp; But the good-humoured smile of conscious
superiority in his profession, that plays upon his features, is
the market-gardener&rsquo;s peculiar fascination.&nbsp; Talk to
him of chemical manures or rich guano, how he will smile! and
what a tale will he unfold of roses all burnt up, geraniums run
to <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>leaf, polyanthuses converted into cabbages, without the
advantage of being edible; auriculas dying, &amp;c.&nbsp;
&ldquo;May do <i>somewheres</i>, but not for flower or
market-gardens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond him, lies spread out a rich
carpet of flowers, grouped by the hands of younger and humbler
ones, whom one might almost call the lay floricultural
professors.&nbsp; Geraniums, and fuchsias, and bright blue
salvias, verbenas of every hue, from deep maroon, through
crimson, up to white; sweet-scented heliotrope, and richly shaded
primroses, that make the tenants of the woods look pale with
envy.&nbsp; A pity it seems to disturb the harmony of colour, so
perfect a parterre does it form, with the back-ground of shrubs
that stand in such rich clusters behind them, all waiting to be
transplanted to new homes.&nbsp; In the very midst of them rises
a mysterious-looking little ark of canvass, resting from its
weekly labour of perambulating the streets and suburbs through
which it has been borne, sedan fashion, by the pair of
unclassical-looking hobbledehoys that own the gay treasures it is
formed to shelter, and whose lips can manage to send forth a
string of nomenclature that may fairly shake the nerves of any
modest purchaser.&nbsp; Sweet simple-looking little floral gems,
they will recommend to notice as Gilea rosea adorata, Clarkia
fimbricata, Coreopsis nigra, speciosa, Colinsea rubra, all hardy
annuals; and with the utmost nonchalance describe <!-- page
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>some trembling little creeper as Trop&oelig;lum
Campatica Fuchsia Carolin&aelig;, Campanula Campatica, and
Lobelia ramosa, all safely meant, we presume, to conceal the
relationship of the owners to the familiar tenants of the cottage
border.&nbsp; A novice must seize in desperation upon some one
that, shorn of its <i>ishii</i> or <i>osum</i>, may chance to be
remembered, lest his fate should resemble that of the fair lady,
who once professed to own in her garden the &ldquo;aurora
borealis&rdquo; and &ldquo;delirium tremens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the scientific nurseries that clothe almost every
outskirt of the city, may perhaps be found grander exotics, or
more luxuriant varieties of floral beauty; but these fragments of
botanic skill and lore are fair specimens of the inheritance
bequeathed to the sons of the soil by those great master-minds
whose gardens once drew Evelyn from the metropolis upon a visit
to this then pre-eminent seat of wealth and magnificence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My Lord&rsquo;s Gardens,&rdquo; that skirted the
water-side, whose quadrangle contained a bowling-green, a
wilderness, and garden, with walks of forty feet in breadth
surrounding them, have passed away, a fragment of the wilderness
alone remains to mark the site of the glorious displays of wealth
and fashion once paraded among them; but the name, associated
with the memory of the times, is a star of the first magnitude,
in the galaxy of the city&rsquo;s firmament of great men.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Sir Thomas Browne, the philosopher, the physician, the
naturalist, the antiquarian, and the botanist, the associate and
friend of the most eminent men that graced the age in which he
lived, and the historian whose works have enriched the literature
of the world, stands first in the long list of names that are
linked with the beauties of the vegetable kingdom; a city that
has sent forth a Lindley, a Hooker, and a Smith, to be professors
in the great world of science, as his followers, has cause,
indeed to honour the memory of him who sowed the first seeds in
the garden, that has reared such giants from its soil.</p>
<p>But there is yet another picture to be viewed of homely
traffic; the Christmas market-day, when the old place and people
seem to be in the zenith of their glory.&nbsp; Each poultry-stall
overflowing with the turkeys, geese, and fowls, that have not
found an exit through the myriad avenues opened for their flight
to every province, town, and city in the land.&nbsp; There they
lie in state, sharing the sovereignty of the season, with
bright-gemmed holly boughs and pearly mistletoe, that deck and
garnish every pad, and stall, and bench, and lie heaped up in
shining stacks of magnitude that may well suggest to the young
novice a question as to how the slow-growing holly and rare
parasite could have been found year after year in such
profusion.&nbsp; Country walks, holly-skirted lanes, and park
enclosures, may tell <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>something of the one; and alas! for
the poetry of the Druids and the oaks, the apple orchards now
claim almost the sole honour of giving shelter to the
other&mdash;the ancient deity of the woods; they will scarce
allow the king of the forest a partial share in the tribute
offerings to merry Christmas.</p>
<p>The bustling eve, when midnight surprises the scrambling teems
of &ldquo;Trotty Vecks,&rdquo; gathering up the fragments left
from rich folk&rsquo;s caterings, that they too may have a savour
of something more than the compliments of the season; when the
remnants of the bountiful display that has been hoarded up for
the highest bidders through the busy day, are auctioned off at
the buyer&rsquo;s own price, and fall thus perchance within the
compass of the weaver&rsquo;s earnings, then is the hour to see
the spirit of peace and good-will towards men stalking abroad,
and lifting from men&rsquo;s hearts and faces the load of
weariness and veil of care, transmuting by his magic touch the
poor man&rsquo;s copper into gold, and giving to his little
stores a widow&rsquo;s cruise-like power to cheer and comfort
happy living hearts.&nbsp; No one who dwells in the old city
should deem it fruitless toil to wend their way through the old
market-place on Christmas Eve, and take a poet&rsquo;s lesson
from the scene!</p>
<p>But there are other pictures still to be seen within the
quaint old Elizabethan frame-work of the city&rsquo;s
market-place than scenes of merchandise, in these days <!-- page
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>of
monster meetings.&nbsp; Who can forget the human gatherings that
have many a time and oft, within the limits of even
childhood&rsquo;s memory, been witnessed here, when gable roofs,
and parapets, windows, and balconies, church towers, and
Guildhall leads, have swarmed with living thousands; gay dressed
&ldquo;totties&rdquo; and dames, aye, and sober-minded lords of
the creation too! all eager and intent to watch from safe
quarters some common object of attraction that has drawn together
a mighty multitude of the people, with their proverbial love of
sight-seeing, an inheritance bequeathed to them by their
ancestral pageantries.&nbsp; Slight stimulus is needed to send
the heart&rsquo;s blood of the city through every vein and artery
to this centre, where it pulsates in deep and heavy throbs of
joy, or hope, or anger, as the case may be; true, in these modern
days the common wants and common blessings that have bound the
sympathies of the million into one, cause the spectacle of
tumultuous hate and bitterness, knocking together of heads,
&amp;c, to be a rare manifestation of popular enthusiasm; more
frequently one desire, one feeling animates the body aggregate,
be it to see the mammoth train of a Hughes or Van Amburgh, the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> of a royal duke, the failure of a promised
fountain bid to play by a new water company, the more successful
display of fireworks at the same behest, the popping of some
threescore pensioners in honour of some <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>royal
birthday, or the advent of some political election.&nbsp; On each
and all of such occasions, and many more, the filling up of the
frame-work is a picture of life, of concentrated human power,
will, and passion, full of effect; may be, it needs an adequate
cause to give it full strength, but everywhere it is full of
interest, and the good old city&rsquo;s market-place would not be
fairly chronicled were its monster meetings of sight-seers deemed
unworthy a passing comment.&nbsp; Pageantry has been numbered
among the chartered rights of the citizens, from the days of
&ldquo;mysteries,&rdquo; when the itinerant stage, with its
sacred drama provided by the church, was the only theatre known,
through the age of tournaments, the season of royal visits,
Elizabethan processions, and triumphal arches, of guilds, of
Georges and dragons, down to the last relic of the spirit of
olden times&mdash;the chairing of its members; and not even the
scant nourishment offered in this nineteenth century, has yet
sufficed to starve and wither the seeds thus sown and fostered in
the very nature of the people.</p>
<p>In a work that professes not to follow out the thread of
history through all its variable windings, or note consecutively
all the beads of truth that have been carved by the hand of time,
and strung upon its surface, but only here and there to pause, as
some gem more glittering than its fellows meets the eye, or some
quaint rude relic of a day gone by <!-- page 134--><a

to a passing curiosity, wonder, or pity, we feel at liberty to
make a kaleidoscope sort of <i>pattern</i> of our gleanings and
notes on the old market-place.&nbsp; Interwoven with its
progress, and associated with its memories, must be almost every
historical reminiscence, peculiarly belonging to an important
municipality, and thriving mart of commerce and manufactures;
from the first simple gatherings in the outer court of the
castle, to the days when trades and crafts, brought over by
Norman intruders, and flourishing under the skilful tutelage of
Flemish refugees, clustered together in groups around the old
croft, the saddlers, the hosiers, the tanners, the mercers, the
parmenters, the goldsmiths, the cutlers, each with their own
<i>row</i>, to the time when staples were fixed, or right of
wholesale dealing granted&mdash;when cloth halls witnessed the
measuring and sealing by government inspectors of every
manufactured piece of cloth, to ensure fairness of dealing
between buyer and seller&mdash;when sumptuary laws regulated
quantity, quality, and pattern of the dresses of all dutiful and
loyal subjects&mdash;down through ages of fluctuating
vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity&mdash;tremulous
shakings&mdash;and reviving struggles against the tide of
competition that has sunk the first and greatest manufacturing
city our country once could boast, beneath the level of many a
nurseling of yesterday, a mere mushroom in growth and
age&mdash;from the era <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of
ultra-carnivorous diet, when boars, peacocks, venison, and
porpoise, were scattered in plentiful profusion on the boards of
butchers&rsquo; stalls, and in the regions of
&ldquo;<i>Puleteria</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;when the potato, brocoli,
turnip, onion, and radish, were unknown&mdash;the tansy, the
rampion, cow cabbage, and salsify, their only substitutes in the
days when vegetarians were not;&mdash;when quinces, medlars, rude
grapes, and mulberries, wild raspberries and strawberries,
supplied the place of a modern dessert, with the valuable addenda
of hazel, and walnuts, whose beautiful wood even then was prized
as an article of manufacture for cups and bowls, under the name
of <i>masere</i>&mdash;down to the scene of the present day, as
it has been pictured already.</p>
<p>Manifold have been the fleeting shadows that have peopled its
disc, now bright, now dark, its area now traversed by triumphal
arches and gorgeous processions, now serving as a platform for a
gallows, whereon a Roberts and a Barber suffered for their
loyalty to his majesty, Charles the First; in one age witnessing
the rise of an oratory in its very midst, and a chaplain to
minister to spiritual cravings, in the heart of material
abundance; the next echoing to the ruthless hammers of
destructive zealots, sweeping from their path every stone or
carving that bore trace of the finger of the &ldquo;scarlet
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But although a consecutive detail of its rise and progress may
not be within the province of our pen, <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>we may
endeavour to trace a few of the leading features of its history
since the era of its first rise into existence as a fishing
hamlet, when the sea washed its shores, and the huts of a few
fishermen, perhaps, were the only habitations scattered over its
surface.&nbsp; Here they dwelt, no doubt, in peaceful security,
when the huge mound, topped with its towering castle, rose up in
their midst, and their sovereigns fixed their dwelling-place
within its strongholds, to be succeeded, after the departure of
the Romans, by the feudal lords or earls of Danish and Saxon
conquerors, in whose time the market-place was the magna crofta
or great croft of the castle.&nbsp; At the gates of the ancient
castles the markets were continually set, following the precedent
of the assemblage of booths that gathered round the gates of the
Roman camps.&nbsp; These, from being at first moveable stalls or
shelters for goods, grew in after-years into towns, boroughs, and
cities, many of them taking their names from the castles or
camps, and were called <i>chesters</i>.&nbsp; The country people
were not allowed to carry provisions into Roman camps; at each
gate was a strong guard, that suffered none to enter the camp
without licence from the commanding officer: this guard consisted
of one <i>cohort</i>, and one troop at least, from which sprung
the modern term of <i>court</i>, or <i>cohort</i>, of
guard.&nbsp; The commanding officer of the guard at the gate had
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>oversight of the market, punished such as sold by false
weights and measures, brought bad provisions, or were guilty of
any other offence in the market, and arbitrated in all cases of
dispute.&nbsp; The Saxons, those exterminating conquerors, who so
liberally parcelled out their neighbours&rsquo; territory into
the famous divisions of the Heptarchy, next figured upon the
scene, and the <i>castellans</i> succeeded the officer of the
guard in the duties of his office, in later times to be fulfilled
by pie-powder courts and clerks of the market.&nbsp; At this
period, markets at the castle gates grew so important as to be
composed of durable houses, as durable at least as wooden
shambles were likely to be; and of such like constructions were
the first outlines of the market-place composed, the
fishmongers&rsquo; and butchers&rsquo; shops of the present day
being the nearest similitudes that can be found to illustrate
their features.</p>
<p>From this time the history of the market-place becomes
identified with the progress of the borough, its struggles for
growth being somewhat impeded, we fancy, by the tithes and taxes
extorted by barons and bishops, between whom we may fancy the
poor fisherfolks began to &ldquo;fare rather sadly,&rdquo;
scarcely knowing what was their own, or if, indeed, they had any
own at all.&nbsp; To sum up their miseries, old chroniclers
record that about this time the sea began to withdraw its arm,
which to them had been a great support, <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>and the
fishermen, who were bound to pay an annual tithe of herrings to
the bishops of the <i>see</i>, found themselves in much the same
plight as the Israelites of old, when doomed to make bricks
without straw&mdash;in their case to supply herrings without a
fishery&mdash;and were therefore reduced to the unpleasant
necessity of thenceforth purchasing the wherewith to pay the
lasting imposition.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all these impediments
the progress of the borough was rapid; houses and churches sprung
up thick and fast; so that at the time of the survey, in the
reign of the &ldquo;Confessor,&rdquo; we find record of
twenty-five parish churches, and one thousand three hundred
burgesses; of sheep-walks, mills, and hides of land, (a hide
being as much as one plough could till in a year,) of taxes, of
honey, and bear dogs.</p>
<p>Churches were owned indiscriminately by bishops, earls, and
burgesses; the materials of which they were constructed, chiefly
wood, though occasionally rough flints and stones cemented by a
durable mortar were substituted; the towers were circular, bricks
were employed for pavements, and bells were used.&nbsp; The
ancients conceived the sound of metal to be an antidote against
evil spirits; and the adoption of bells into the Christian
church, and their consecration, was but a variation of the
practices of the pagans, who at the feasts of Vulcan and Minerva,
consecrated trumpets for religious uses.</p>
<p><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Such was the condition of the town and market-place,
when the Norman Conqueror, whose coming produced such mighty
changes in the land, brought over from the continent a host of
foreigners, who settled themselves down in almost every part of
the kingdom, and introduced trades and crafts of every variety,
giving birth to the great manufacturing spirit that has grown to
be so distinguishing a feature of our national greatness.&nbsp;
Among the foreigners who established themselves in this district,
we find the name of <i>Wimer</i>, a name yet prefixed to one of
the great wards or districts of the city&mdash;the Wimer
ward.&nbsp; At this period, perhaps the most prominent
characteristic of the secular history of the times, especially in
connection with trade, is the important position held by the
Jews.</p>
<p>The Norman duke had brought with him a great number of this
race of people, and although their religion was despised and
bitterly hated, they monopolized almost every branch of trade,
and so much of the learning of the day, that they took a high
place both in commercial and civil transactions.&nbsp; In this
city they successively had two extensive synagogues and colleges,
where medicine and rabbinical divinity were taught together.</p>
<p>Pharmacy, education, and all monetary transactions of any
importance, seem to have come within their province, their
utility and wealth preserving them, <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>for the
time at least, from anything more than petty persecution.&nbsp;
The history, however, of little St. William, given elsewhere, and
other similar records that have been handed down, betray the
jealousy and ill-will that existed between them and the
Christians, even during the season of their prosperity, when
royalty, as in the time of Rufus, patronized them.</p>
<p>Meantime the city had become a bishopric; a monastery, three
friaries, and a nunnery sprung up in quick succession, betraying
the growth of ecclesiastical power, and the presence of a great
rival to the secular authority claimed by the ministers of civil
justice; itinerant judges had been established for trying great
crimes, such as murder or theft, and coroners had been instituted
to hold inquests upon any persons dying suddenly, or found dead;
either to acquit them of self murder, or seize their goods; the
citizens were also exempted from the judgment of the law by
single combat by Richard I.&nbsp; Among the events of interest
bearing very early date is the royal visit of the first Henry, in
the day when the king was his own tax-gatherer, and when, failing
to receive his dues in lawful coin of the realm, he was wont to
take them in kind, and to tarry until himself and suite had eaten
up the hogs and sheep, and cows and geese, whose addition to his
retinue would have been otherwise very burdensome.&nbsp; So
liberal <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>was the entertainment afforded the
royal visitor here, that his majesty was pleased to confer upon
the citizens many privileges as a mark of gratitude, among which
exemption from such like visitations in future was included.</p>
<p>The next visit of royalty is attributed to Edward the First,
whose generosity was evidenced by the command issued speedily
after his return thither, that the Jews throughout the kingdom
should be charged with unlawfully clipping and adulterating the
coin of the realm, as an excuse for their persecution,
imprisonment, and final extermination.&nbsp; The religious
antipathies of the zealous crusader would not suffice to explain
these atrocities; but the ambition of the warlike monarch seeking
to replenish his exhausted treasury, that he might prosecute
expensive foreign enterprises, gives a more satisfactory clue to
the origin of cruelties, that led to such important confiscations
being made to the crown.&nbsp; In obedience to the royal will,
the beautiful college of the Jews in this city was plundered and
burnt, its coffers emptied into the royal exchequer, and its
tenants banished or imprisoned.&nbsp; An inn, called
&ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; was soon after raised in the
immediate neighbourhood, to memorialize the event; but an old
ricketty gable or two, hidden away behind fair modern frontings
of brickwork and stucco, is all that remains of this
monument.&nbsp; St. George in combat with the <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Dragon, now
figures on the sign board affixed to the inn that occupies one
portion of its site.</p>
<p>It is some credit to the ministers of justice in the city,
that we find upon their records, traces of the efforts made to
bring to punishment some of the actual perpetrators of the
outrages in Jewry, albeit they could perhaps only be deemed
instruments in the hands of higher powers.&nbsp; Extracts from
the &ldquo;Coroners&rsquo; Rolls,&rdquo; containing accounts of
robberies and street frays in this reign and the preceding, prove
this fact, and afford in addition curious evidence of the state
of society at that period.&nbsp; For the quaint and amusing
details they give, we must render thanks to the learned and
skilled in antiquarian lore, obsolete orthography, black letter
type, &amp;c., but, for whose assistance in rescuing them from
obscurity, and interpreting their meaning, they must to us have
remained veiled in an impenetrable incognita.</p>
<p>Amongst them is the record of an &ldquo;inquisition made of
the fire raised in Jewry,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;precept given to
apprehend all the felons concerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another is so
graphic, that we feel able to see the whole picture it gives at a
glance&mdash;the widow sitting beside the bier of her husband,
the sanctity of her sorrow invaded by brute violence, the house
pillaged, and the corpse plundered and burnt in the agonised
wife&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; The words of the roll say,
&ldquo;Katharina, the wife of Stephen Justice, accused <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Ralph, son of Robert Andrew, the gaoler, William Kirby
Gaunter, William Crede, Walter de Hereham, John, servant of
Nicholas de Ingham, and Nicholas sometime servant of Nicholas de
Sopham, and Nicholas de Gayver, that when she was at peace with
God and the king, in the house of Stephen Justice her husband,
and the Thursday night after the feast of King Edmund, in the
forty-eighth year of the reign of King Henry, the son of King
John (1263), they came in the town of Norwich, in Fybriggate, St.
Clement&rsquo;s, and broke the oaken gates, and the hooks and the
hinges of iron, with hatchets, bars, wedges, swords, knives, and
maces, and flung them down into the court, and feloniously
entered; that they then broke the pine wood doors of the hall,
and the hinges and iron work of them, and the chains, bolts, and
oaken boards of the windows.&nbsp; Afterwards they entered the
door of the hall chamber towards the south, and robbed that
chamber of two swords, value 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, one ivory
handled anlace, value 12<i>d.</i>, one iron head piece, value
10<i>d.</i>, an iron staff, value 4<i>d.</i>; one cow leather
quirre (cuirass) with iron plates, value half a mark; and one
wambeis (a body garment stuffed with cotton, wool, or tow), and
coming thence into the hall, they burnt the body of her husband,
as it there lay upon a bier, together with a blanket of
&lsquo;reins,&rsquo; value 3<i>s.</i>; and took away with them a
linen cloth, value 18<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The said Katharina <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>immediately raised hue and cry, from street to street,
from parish to parish, and from house to house, until she came
into the presence of the bailiffs and coroners.&nbsp; They also
stole a lined cloth of the value of 5<i>s.</i>, and one hood of
<i>Pers</i> (Persian) with squirrel&rsquo;s fur, value
10<i>s.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A writer in the Arch&aelig;ological Journal describes the
houses of this period as possessing only a ground floor, of which
the principal apartment was the aire, aitre, or hall, into which
the principal door opened, and which was the room for cooking,
eating, receiving visitors, and the other ordinary uses of
domestic life.&nbsp; Adjacent to this, was the chamber which was
by day the private apartment and resort of the female portion of
the household, and by night the bed room.&nbsp; Strangers and
visitors generally slept in the hall, beds being made for them on
the floor.&nbsp; A stable was frequently adjacent to the hall,
probably on the side opposite to the chamber or bed-room.</p>
<p>Another memorandum on the rolls, records the deaths of Henry
Turnecurt and Stephen de Walsham, who &ldquo;were killed in the
parish of St. George, before the gate of the Holy Trinity, St.
Philip and James&rsquo; day, in the same year.&nbsp; The coroners
and bailiffs went and made inquisition.&nbsp; Inquisition then
made was set forth in a certain schedule.&nbsp; Afterwards came
master Marc de Bunhale, clerk, and Ralph Knict, with many others,
threatening the <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>coroners to cut them to pieces,
unless the schedule was given up, and then they took Roger the
coroner, and by force led him to his own house, with swords and
axes, until the said Roger took the schedule from his chest; and
then they took him with the schedule to St. Peter of Mancroft
church, and there the aforesaid Ralph tore away the schedule from
the hands of Roger, and bore it away, and before his companions,
in the manner of fools, cut it into small pieces; and with much
ado, Roger the coroner escaped from their hands in great fear and
tremor.&nbsp; The coroners say they cannot make inquisition, by
reason of the imminence of the war.&rdquo;&nbsp; The disturbances
alluded to were the dissensions going on between the king and
barons.</p>
<p>Another describes an attack of four men, one of them a priest,
upon one man in his shop in the market, where he was
killed.&nbsp; Among many other similar accounts of these troubled
times, stands the description of various felons, who sheltered
themselves within the walls of the sanctuary, a privilege
permitted from the time of Alfred, whose laws granted protection
for three days and nights to any within the walls of a church;
William the Conqueror confirmed and extended the privilege.&nbsp;
In the times of feudal tyranny, this refuge was oftentimes of
considerable advantage to innocent persons falsely accused, but
as frequently was the shelter of crime.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>In a case quoted from this authority, the felon
professes to have sought refuge from punishment awaiting
robberies, of which he acknowledges himself guilty.&nbsp; Upon
the church of St. Gregory there yet remains a curious escutcheon,
a part of the knocker, always then placed upon the door of a
church, for the purpose of aiding those who sought refuge in
sanctuary.&nbsp; A curious account of the ceremony of abjuration
of the realm by one who had taken refuge in Durham Cathedral, is
given in the York volume of the Arch&aelig;ological
Institute.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A man from Wolsingham is committed to
prison for theft.&nbsp; He escapes, and seeks refuge in the
Cathedral.&nbsp; He takes his stand before the shrine of St.
Cuthbert, and begs for a coroner.&nbsp; John Rachet, the coroner
of Chester ward, goes to him, and hears his confession.&nbsp; The
culprit, in the presence of the sacrist, sheriff, under-sheriff,
and others, by a solemn oath renounces the kingdom.&nbsp; He then
strips himself to his shirt, and gives up his clothing to the
sacrist as his fee.&nbsp; The sacrist restores the
clothing&mdash;a white cross of wood is put into his hand, and he
is consigned to the under-sheriff, who commits him to the care of
the nearest constable, who hands him over to the next, and he to
the next, in the direction of the coast.&nbsp; The last constable
puts him into a ship, and he bids an eternal farewell to his
country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>There were usually chambers over the porches of
churches, in which two men slept, for the purpose of being ready
at all hours to admit applicants.&nbsp; In proof of the expense
attending the maintaining of persons in the sanctuary, it is said
that &ldquo;in 1491, the burgesses in parliament acquainted the
assembly that they had been at great expense in getting an
ordinance of parliament to authorize them in a quiet way to take
one John Estgate out of sanctuary, the said John having entered
the churchyard of St. Simon and St. Jude, and there remained for
a long time past, during which time, the city being compelled to
keep watch on him day and night, lest he should escape, was at
great charge and trouble.&nbsp; The ordinance being passed, John
Pynchamour, one of the burgessess, went to the sanctuary and
asked John Estgate whether he would come out and submit to the
law, or no; and upon his answering he &lsquo;would not,&rsquo; he
in a quiet manner went to him, led him to the Guildhall, and
committed him to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another entry of an event that transpired during the troubled
reign of Henry III., bears reference to the memorable disputes
between the citizens and the monks of the priory, of which the
Ethelbert gateway, leading into the Cathedral Close, is a
monument; the citizens having had the penance of erecting it,
imposed upon them for their destructive attacks upon the
monastery, a great portion of which, <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>including
parts of the cathedral, they pillaged and burnt.&nbsp; The record
states that &ldquo;one John Casmus was found slain on the Tuesday
next after the feast of St. Laurence, by William de Brunham,
prior of Norwich, at the gates of St. Trinity, on the eastern
side; the said prior having struck him with a certain
&lsquo;fanchone&rsquo; on the head, from which blow he instantly
died.&nbsp; The coroners are afraid to make inquisition, for fear
of a felonious assault; a result rendered very probable by the
known temper of the prior, who, by his violent conduct, is said
to have contributed materially to the unhappy
disturbances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-cherished bitterness and jealousies respecting their
several limits of jurisdiction, had found occasion for outbreak
the preceding week to that mentioned in the record, at the annual
fair, held on Trinity Sunday, before the gates of the cathedral,
on the ground known as Tombland, from having anciently been a
burial place.&nbsp; The servants of the monastery, and the
citizens, had come into collision at some games that were going
on upon the Tuesday, and a violent conflict ensued, which lasted
for a considerable time.&nbsp; The writers of the time are
divided as to the blameable parties; the monks being accused of
aiding and abetting their servants in doing wrong, and
<i>vexing</i> the people; the citizens, in their turn, being
condemned for transgressing the recognized laws which existed
concerning the boundaries of the prior&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>The animosities never fairly could be said to have
ceased until the general destruction of all monastic power at the
period of the Reformation.</p>
<p>One more curious extract we will make from these
coroner&rsquo;s rolls, remarkable as being one of the very few
authentic accounts to be met with of a person being restored to
life after execution.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Walter Eye was condemned in the court of
Norwich, and hung, and appeared dead, but was afterwards
discovered to be alive by William, the son of Thomas Stannard;
and the said Walter was carried in a coffin to the church of St.
George&rsquo;s, before the gate of St. Trinity, where he
recovered in fifteen days, and then fled from that church to the
church of the Holy Trinity, and there was, until the king upon
his suit pardoned him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was formerly a prevalent idea that felons could only be
suspended for a certain time, but this was not really the case;
so far from it, Hale&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pleas of the Crown&rdquo;
asserts, &ldquo;that, in case a man condemned to die, come to
life after he is hanged, as the judgment is not executed till he
is <i>dead</i>, he ought to be hung up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another anecdote, extracted from the books of the corporation,
bearing a more recent date, possesses a double interest, from
being connected with a memorable disturbance, dignified in local
history by the title of Gladman&rsquo;s Insurrection, and also
from the <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>name and rank of the lady concerned,
who was grand-daughter to Chaucer, the poet, and wife of William
de la Pole, who succeeded to the earldom of Suffolk upon the
death of his brother Michael, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1415, the second year of the reign of King Henry V.</p>
<p>The only liberty we shall take with the original account is to
slightly abridge it, and render it in modern orthography.</p>
<p>Item.&nbsp; It was so, that Alice, Duchess, that time Countess
of Suffolk, lately in person came to this city, disguised like a
country house-wife.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Tuddenham, and two other
persons, went with her, also disguised; and they, to take their
disports, went out of the city one evening, near night, so
disguised, towards a hovel called Lakenham Wood, to take the air,
and disport themselves, beholding the said city.&nbsp; One Thomas
Ailmer, of Norwich, esteeming in his conceit that the said
duchess and Sir Thomas had been other persons, met them, and
opposed their going out in that wise, and fell at variance with
the said Sir Thomas, so that they fought; whereby the said
duchess was sore afraid; by cause whereof the said duchess and
Sir Thomas took a displeasure against the city, notwithstanding
that the mayor of the city at that time being, arrested Thomas
Ailmer, and held him in prison more than thirty weeks without
bail; to the intent thereby both to chastise Ailmer, and to
appease <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>the displeasure of the said duchess
and Sir Thomas; and also the said mayor arrested and imprisoned
all other persons which the said duchess and Sir Thomas could
understand had in any way given favour or comfort to the said
Ailmer, in making the affray.&nbsp; Notwithstanding which
punishment, the displeasure of the duchess and Sir Thomas was not
appeased.&nbsp; And it is so, moreover, that one John Haydon,
late was recorder of the city, taking of the mayor and citizens a
reasonable fee, as the recorder is accustomed; he, being so
recorded, had interlaced himself with the prior of Norwich, at
that time being <i>in travers</i> with the said mayor and
commonality, and discovered the privity of the evidence of the
said city to the said prior, because whereof the mayor and
commons of the said city discharged the said Haydon of the
condition of recorder; for which Haydon took a displeasure
against the said city.</p>
<p>By malice of these displeasures of the said duchess, Sir
Thomas Tuddenham, and John Haydon, the Duke of Suffolk, then
earl, in his person, upon many suggestions by the said Tuddenham
and Haydon to him made, that the mayor, aldermen, and commonality
aforesaid, should have misgoverned the city, laboured and made to
be taken out of the chancery a commission of over
determiner.&nbsp; And thereupon, at a sessions holden at
Thetford, the Thursday next after the feast of St. Matthew the
Apostle, the said <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Sir Thomas and John Haydon, finding
in their conceit no manner or matter of truth whereof they might
cause the said mayor and commonality there to be indicted,
imagined thus as ensueth: first, they <i>sperde an inquest</i>,
<i>then taken</i> in a chamber, at one Spilmer&rsquo;s house; in
which chamber the said T. <i>lodged</i>, <i>and so kept them
sperde</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And it was so, that one John Gladman, of
Norwich, which was then, and at this hour, is a man of
&lsquo;sad&rsquo; dispositions, and true and faithful to God and
to the king, of disport, as is and hath been accustomed in any
city or borough through all this realm, on fasting Tuesday made a
disport with his neighbours, having his horse trapped with
tinsel, and otherwise disguising things, crowned as King of
Christmas, in token that all mirth should end with the twelve
months of the year; afore him went each month, disguised after
the season thereof; and Lent clad in white, with
red-herring&rsquo;s skins, and his horse trapped with oyster
shells after him, in token that sadness and abstinence of mirth
should follow, and an holy time; and so rode in divers streets of
the city, with other people with him disguised, making mirth, and
disport, and plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said Sir Thomas and John Haydon, among many other
full strange and untrue presentments, made by perjury at the said
inquest, caused the said mayor and commonality, and the said John
<!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Gladman, to be indicted of that, that they should have
imagined to have made a common rising, and have crowned the said
John Gladman as king, with crown, sceptre and diadem, (when they
never meant it), nor such a thing imagined, as in the said
presentiment it showeth more plain, and by that presentiment,
with many other horrible articles therein comprised, so made by
perjury, thay caused the franchise of the said city to be seized
into the king&rsquo;s hands, to the harm and cost of the said
mayor and commonality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now we take a long stride from the reign of Henry V. to
that of Charles II., omitting the intermediate century that was
marked by the royal visit of the maiden queen, chronicled at
length among the &ldquo;pageantries;&rdquo; and passing over the
troubled era of the Commonwealth, the Reformation, and
&ldquo;Kett&rsquo;s rebellion,&rdquo; all of which have found a
place for notice elsewhere, we find ourselves once more in the
smooth waters of peace, with the tide of prosperity at the full
within the walls of the old city; and we ask no pardon for making
copious extracts from the journal that furnished Macaulay with
materials to serve up the rich banquet that lies condensed in the
few lines devoted to this period of the city&rsquo;s history, in
his unrivalled work.&nbsp; The diary of Dr. Edward Browne gives a
picture of the society and habits of <!-- page 154--><a

citizens in his time, perhaps not to be met with elsewhere.&nbsp;
His father, Sir Thomas Browne, then tenanted the house now known
by the title of the &ldquo;Star,&rdquo; and in the winter of
1663&ndash;4 was visited by his son Edward, who, during his stay,
made the entries in his journal which we have extracted.&nbsp; At
that time, Henry, afterwards Lord Howard, of Castle Rising,
subsequently Earl of Norwich, and Marshal of England, resided in
the city, at the palace of his brother, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk,
who was an invalid, on the continent, suffering from disease of
the brain.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jan. 1st. (1663&ndash;4.)&nbsp; I was at
Mr. Howard&rsquo;s, brother to the Duke of Norfolk, who kept his
Christmas this year at the Duke&rsquo;s palace in Norwich, so
magnificently that the like hath scarce been seen.&nbsp; They had
dancing every night, and gave entertainments to all that would
come; <i>hee</i> built up a room on purpose to dance in, very
large, and hung with the bravest hangings I ever saw; his
candlesticks, snuffers, <i>tongues</i>, fire-shovel, and
and-irons, were silver; a banquet was given every night after
dancing; and three coaches were employed every afternoon to fetch
ladies, the greatest of which would holde fourteen persons, and
coste five hundred pounde, without the harnesse, which cost six
score more; I have seen of his pictures, which are admirable; he
hath prints and draughts, done by most of the great
masters&rsquo; <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>own hands.&nbsp; Stones and jewels,
as onyxes, sardonyxes, jacinths, jaspers, amethysts, &amp;c. more
and better than any prince in Europe.&nbsp; Ringes and seales,
all manner of stones, and limnings beyond compare.&nbsp; These
things were most of them collected by the old Earl of Arundel
(the Duke&rsquo;s grandfather).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Mr. Howard hath lately bought a piece of ground of
Mr. Mingay, in Norwich, by the waterside in Cunisford, which hee
intends for a place of walking and recreation, having made
already walkes round and across it, forty feet in breadth; if the
quadrangle left be spacious enough, he intends the first of them
for a bowling-green, the third for a wildernesse, and the fourth
for a garden.&nbsp; These and the like noble things he
performeth, and yet hath paid 100,000 pounds of his
ancestors&rsquo; debts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 6th.&nbsp; I dined at my Aunt Bendish&rsquo;s, and
made an end of Christmas at the Duke&rsquo;s palace, with dancing
at night and a great banquet.&nbsp; His gates were opened, and
such a number flocked in, that all the beer they could set out in
the streets could not divert the stream of the multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 7th.&nbsp; I opened a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 9th.&nbsp; Mr. Osborne sent my father a calf,
whereof I observed the knee joint, and the neat articulation of
the put-bone, which was here very perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day Monsieur Buttet, who plays most admirably <!--

three-square instrument, having but one string, came to see
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 11th.&nbsp; This day, being Mr. Henry
Howard&rsquo;s birthday, we danced at Mr. Howard&rsquo;s, till 2
of the clock in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jan. 13th.&nbsp; This day I met Mr. Howard at my Uncle
Bendish&rsquo;s, where he taught me to play at
<i>l&rsquo;hombre</i>, a Spanish game at cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 21st.&nbsp; I shewed Dr. De Veau about the town; I
supped with him at the Duke&rsquo;s palace, where he shewed a
powder against agues, which was to be given in white wine, to the
quantity of three grains.&nbsp; He related to me many things of
the Duke of Norfolk, that lives at Padua, <i>non compos
mentis</i>, and of his travailes in France and Italy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. 23rd.&nbsp; Don Francisco de Melo came from
London, with Mr. Philip Howard (third grandson of the Earl of
Arundel), to visit his honour, Mr. Henry Howard.&nbsp; I met them
at Mr. Deyes the next day, in Madam Windham&rsquo;s chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boyled the right fore-foot of a monkey, and took out
all the bones, which I keep by me.&nbsp; In a put-bone, the
unfortunate casts are outward, the fortunate inward.</p>

ague, upon which Dr. De Veau was to try his febrifuge powder; but
the ague being but moderate, and in the declension, it was
thought too mean a disease to try the efficacy of his extolled
powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 2nd.&nbsp; I saw cock-fighting at the White Horse,
in St. Stephen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 5th.&nbsp; I went to see a <i>serpent</i>, that a
woman, living in St. Gregory&rsquo;s church-yard, vomited up, but
she had burnt it before I came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feb. 16th.&nbsp; I went to visit Mr. Edward Ward, an
old man in a fever, where Mrs. Anne Ward gave me my first fee,

London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quaint admixture of scientific research,
pleasure-seeking, and superstitious credulity, blended with
intellectual enquiry, affords a curious picture of the domestic
and professional habits of a physician of the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; The father of the writer, the eminent Dr. Thomas
Browne, received the order of knighthood from his majesty, King
Charles II., on the occasion of his visiting the city in 1671,
when he dined in state at the New Hall (St. Andrew&rsquo;s); the
same honour was pressed upon the acceptance of the mayor, who,
however, ventured to decline the proffered dignity.&nbsp; In the
reign of James II., we find record of Henry, then Duke of
Norfolk, riding <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>into the market-place at the head of
300 knights, to declare a free parliament, the mayor and sheriffs
meeting him there, and consenting to the act.&nbsp; But the glory
of the palace, once the scene of such regal splendour and
magnificence, was not of long duration.&nbsp; A dispute between
the grandson of the Duke Henry and the mayor of the city,
concerning the entrance of some comedians into the city, playing
their trumpets, &amp;c. on the way to the palace, caused its
owner, Thomas, then Duke, to destroy the greater portion of it,
and leave the remainder untenanted; and among divers
transmutations of property that characterized the era of Queen
Anne, we find the appropriation of its vestiges to the purpose of
a workhouse, when those institutions first sprang into
existence&mdash;a fate shared at the same period by the cloisters
of the old Black Friars monastery.</p>
<p>The river, that once reflected the gorgeous displays of wealth
that glittered upon the margin of its waters, in the palace of
the Dukes, now flows darkly and silently on, through crowded
thoroughfares and gloomy wharfs, and staiths; corn and coal
depots, red brick factories, with their tiers of low
window-ranges and tall chimneys, have usurped the place of
banquetting halls and palace gardens; a toll bridge adds silence
to the gloom, by its prohibitory tax on passers-by, a stillness,
oppressive by its sudden contrast to the activity of neighbouring
thoroughfares, <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>pervades the whole region round
about; and the spot that once was the nucleus of wealth, riches,
and grandeur, now seems the very seat and throne of
melancholy.</p>
<p>Coeval with the rise of workhouses, in the reign of Anne, is
another event of local history&mdash;the introduction of
street-lighting.&nbsp; An act of parliament of William III.,
confirmed in the 10th of Anne, enacted &ldquo;that every
householder charged with 2<i>d.</i> a week to the poor, whose
dwelling-house adjoined any streets, market-places, public lanes,
or passages in the city, should every night, yearly, from
Michaelmas to Lady-day, as it should grow dark, hang out, on the
outside of their houses, <i>a candle</i>, <i>or visible and
convenient lights</i>, and continue the same until eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, for enlightening the streets, and
convenience of passengers, under penalty of 2<i>s.</i> for every
neglect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lamps, at the cost of the community in
general, were soon afterwards substituted, but their shape, and
distance from each other, would seem to have rendered them but
indifferent substitutes for the illuminations that preceded them;
and if memory is faithful to us, in recalling the progenitors of
the gas-lights of the present day, we may form some slight
conception of the pigmy race of ancestors from which they
sprung.</p>
<p>Meantime, during these years of progress and prosperity, while
Time was tracing its finger-marks <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>upon the
walls of men&rsquo;s houses, and writing its lessons on their
hearts and minds, there stood, in the centre of the old
market-place, a little silent symbol of the religious feeling of
the passing ages,&mdash;the market-cross, and oratory within the
little octagonal structure, whose external corners bore upon all
of them the emblem of hope and salvation&mdash;the
crucifix.&nbsp; In its earliest days, its oratory was tenanted by
a priest, supported by the alms of the busy market-folks, who
could find means, in the midst of all their worldly callings, to
pay some tribute in time and money to religion.&nbsp; And was it
such a very foolish practice of our ignorant old forefathers,
thus to bring the sanctuary into the very midst of the business
of life?&mdash;was it a great proof of childish simplicity, to
seek to sanctify the scenes of merchandize by the presence and
teaching of Christianity?&nbsp; Is it indeed needful that the
elements of our nature, spirit, soul, and body, should be rent
asunder, and fed and nurtured in distinct and separate schools,
until each one of us becomes almost conscious of two separate
existences&mdash;the Sabbath-day life, within the church or
meeting walls, and the week-day business life abroad in the
world?&nbsp; Or shall the union be pronounced more beautiful and
consonant with the laws of harmony, that carries the world into
the sanctuary, and desecrates the house of God by the presence of
sordid passions, crusted round the heart by daily exercise <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>in the great marts of commerce, or in the intercourse
of political or even social life, that not the one day&rsquo;s
rest in seven, spent in listening to some favourite
theologian&rsquo;s intellectual teachings of doctrinal truths, or
controversial dogmas, can suffice to rub off, to purify, or make
clean?&nbsp; A market-cross and priest may not be the remedies
for this disease of later times, but they were outer symbols of
the reality needed&mdash;Christianity, to be carried out into the
every-day actions of the world, mingling with the dealings of man
with man, master and workman, capitalist and consumer,&mdash;that
there may no longer exist those monstrous anomalies that are to
be met with in almost every phase of society in this Christian
land, among a people professing to be guided by the light of
&ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; to walk according to the law of
&ldquo;Charity,&rdquo; and to obey the precept, &ldquo;Love thy
neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the busy hands of zealous reformers long since began their
work upon this little outward expression of
&ldquo;superstition;&rdquo; the priest disappeared, the
crucifixes fell beneath the murmurs of &ldquo;<i>true
Protestants</i>,&rdquo; and the oratory was transferred to the
&ldquo;masters, and searchers, and sellers of leather;&rdquo;
but, in process of time, falling to decay, the little monument
was pulled down, and all traces of its existence obliterated from
the scene of its former dominion.</p>
<p>And now a word upon manufactures.&nbsp; The great <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>parent of English looms, and English weavers of wool,
claims it; the city, that has for centuries robed the priesthood
of Christendom in its camlets; that has invented crapes, and
bombazines, and paramattas, to clothe one-half of the world in
the sable &ldquo;livery of woe;&rdquo; that has draped the fair
daughters of every clime in the graceful folds of its far-famed
&ldquo;filover;&rdquo; that has in later years shod the feet of
no small proportion of the nation&rsquo;s population; whose every
court and alley echoes the throw of the shuttle and rattle of the
loom; whose every cellar and hovel has its winding frame for
childhood and old age to earn their mite upon; whose garrets pour
forth their pale sickly wool-combers, with faces blanched by the
fumes of charcoal; that has its districts of
&ldquo;cord-wainers,&rdquo; and colonies of
&ldquo;binders;&rdquo; its hidden timber-yards, where thousands
of square feet are rapidly being transformed into
&ldquo;vestas&rdquo; and &ldquo;lucifers,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;silent lights;&rdquo; and its tall factories, whose
heaped-up stories send down their streams of human working bees,
from the cells of their monster queen, the steam-engine, and the
task of making produce to supply the rich man&rsquo;s
wants&mdash;has, we say, a claim upon us in her character of a
manufacturing place.&nbsp; The venerable city, once the summit of
the pyramid of our nation&rsquo;s commercial glory, stands no
longer in isolated grandeur, the mistress of trade, but for long
has had to look up at a vast mass of capital and <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>labour, accumulated above her head by the energies and
activities of younger rivals.&nbsp; India has gorged with its raw
material the markets once fed with the wool of home-grown sheep,
and cotton towns have risen up and outgrown the old woollen mart
of the country.&nbsp; Fashion and its fluctuations, machinery and
its progressions, iron and coal in their partial distribution,
have each and all helped to lay the head of the mighty low; but
there is strong vitality left within her&mdash;powerful talents
and great resources; she is even now rising from the lethargy
that had crept over her.&nbsp; Would our space permit, how fain
would we trace the workings yet going on in her midst: the
progress of the shearer&rsquo;s wool from the wool-sack to the
rich brocaded cashmere; through its &ldquo;combing&rdquo; with
irons heated over charcoal furnaces, that poison the atmosphere
around, and shorten the lives of the operatives engaged in it,
forsooth, because the foreman of the manufactory has a perquisite
of selling charcoal,&mdash;thence to the huge factory with giant
engines, and labyrinths of spinning-wheels; away, again, to the
spider-looking winding-frame, that children and old women may
turn to help to fill the shuttles of the abler workers at the
loom; thence to the dyers, and then to the loom itself, where
manhood, youth, and woman&rsquo;s feebler strength alike find
exercise and room for labour.&nbsp; How many histories have been
woven into the <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>fabric&mdash;what tears or smiles
have cast their light or shade upon the tints,&mdash;what notes
of harmony or love, or wailings of sorrow and sickness have
echoed the shuttle&rsquo;s throw,&mdash;how many tales of stern
heart griefs, pining wants, wasting penury, or disease, are
wrapped in the luxurious folds that minister to the comfort and
enjoyment of the unconscious wearer.</p>
<p>But we dare not tarry amid these scenes, richly fraught as
they may be with subject for graphic sketching; we may not pause
to visit the great gatherings in factory chambers, or linger
amongst the home labours of the industrious artisan; can barely
hint at traits of heroism, lives of gentle loving duty going on
amid the rattling noise of looms that trench upon the narrow
limits of the sick bed; deeds of good Samaritanism that grace the
weary weaver&rsquo;s home, or dwell upon the Christian lessons
they have power to teach.&nbsp; If the anatomy of a manufacturing
city does revolt the senses and sensibilities in the pictures of
suffering and poverty it seldom fails to abound with, there is
yet much beauty in the deep, earnest, truthful poetry to be read
in the page it lays open.&nbsp; Mary Barton is no fiction; scarce
a district in a manufacturing province that could not furnish a
heroine like her; nor need we, perhaps, look to the other side of
the Atlantic, to find the prototype of &ldquo;Uncle
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is little doubt that woollen manufactures of <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>some kind existed in this neighbourhood from a very
early period.&nbsp; Sheep were here in great abundance, and as
soon as there were ships to send them in, were exported to other
countries from these parts.&nbsp; Doomsday Book mentions numerous
&ldquo;sheep-walks,&rdquo; covering many acres of ground; whether
these &ldquo;walks&rdquo; comprised such lands as we now term
&ldquo;meadows or pastures,&rdquo; is not explained, but most
probably such is the interpretation to be put upon the term, and
<i>not</i>, as at first sight might seem to be implied, that the
sheep had narrow strips of &ldquo;esplanade,&rdquo; or promenade,
all to themselves, upon which they marched up and down in
regimental order.&nbsp; About these same sheep it has been said,
in these our times, that there exists strong presumptive evidence
that the fine Spanish &ldquo;merino&rdquo; is a lineal descendant
of the family, and that the wool now imported as of foreign
extraction, is literally and truly the growth of the offspring of
respectable English forefathers, some members of whose domestic
circle were honoured by being made presents of to Spanish princes
by the sovereign of England, in the days when the office and
title of shepherd was coveted by nobles in that country.&nbsp;
The hypothesis we pretend not to establish, so &ldquo;revenons
<i>&agrave; nos</i> moutons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preparing of wool was a favourite occupation of the
British ladies of rank; and soon after the settlement of the
Romans, it is recorded by Dionysius <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Alexandrinus, that &ldquo;the wool of Britain was often
spun so fine, that it was in a manner comparable to a
spider&rsquo;s thread.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mother of Alfred is
described as being skilled in the spinning of wool, and busied in
training her daughters to similar occupations.&nbsp; The advent
of the various workmen who followed in the train of the conqueror
from Normandy, caused fresh energy to be infused into this, as
all other branches of manufactures; but the main stimulus was
given by a colony of Dutch, who, driven from their own country by
inundations in the reign of Henry the First, crossed the channel,
and selecting the convenient promontory of Norfolk, settled
themselves down at a little village called <i>Worsted</i>, about
thirteen miles from Norwich, whence the name of the wool first
spun there by them.</p>
<p>In the reign of Stephen the woollen manufactures were so
flourishing in many large towns, that the merchants petitioned
for power to form themselves into distinct guilds or
corporations,&mdash;the earliest development of the principle of
joint stock companies, borrowed by the Normans from the free
cities of Italy, where trade and manufactures had long
flourished, and where this combination of mercantile influence
had been employed by the Roman monarchs as a check upon the
feudal power of the barons.&nbsp; The inconvenience, however,
that attended the monopolies that sprung from this source were
soon manifest; <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>and disturbances were continually
arising, until free trade was in a measure restored.&nbsp; The
sumptuary laws of Edward the Third, and the inducements held out
by him to foreigners to settle in his dominions,&mdash;the fixing
of the <i>staples</i>, that obliged all merchants to bring their
wool and woollen cloths for sale to Norwich, forbidding any to
offer such articles in any other part of Norfolk or
Suffolk,&mdash;tended materially to the commercial prosperity of
the city; but in the reign of Richard the Second, discontent
spread itself throughout the working population of the kingdom,
and the insurrection of Wat Tyler was followed by an open
rebellion in Suffolk, when 80,000 men marched upon Norwich, and
committed divers acts of devastation and plunder, headed by John
Litester, a dyer.&nbsp; This, united to the jealousies that
existed between the native and foreign artisans, caused a decline
in the local manufactures for some time.&nbsp; In
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign they revived, through the invitation
given to the Dutch and Walloons, then fleeing from the
persecutions of the Duke of Alva.&nbsp; By the advice of the Duke
of Norfolk, thirty of these, all experienced workmen, were
invited to attend in Norwich, each bringing with him ten
servants, to be maintained at the expense of the duke.&nbsp;
These speedily multiplied, until their number exceeded five
thousand.&nbsp; No matter of surprise, therefore, is it that the
Old City retains so many quaint traces of <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Flemish
taste and Flemish architecture, or that strangers, one and all,
should be struck with the peculiarly foreign outline of its
quaint old market-place.&nbsp; Soon after the settlement of these
strangers in the neighbourhood, new articles of manufacture were
introduced; in addition to the &ldquo;worsteds,&rdquo;
&ldquo;saies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stamins,&rdquo; hitherto the sole
articles of commerce, and the admixture of mohair and silk with
the wool, produced a total change in the quality of the
goods.&nbsp; Bombazine, that staple &ldquo;mourning garb,&rdquo;
was the first result of the experiments made in silk and wool
combined.&nbsp; The ladies of Spain were thenceforth supplied
with the material for that indispensable article of their
costume, the mantilla.&nbsp; Camlets, too, were woven for the
religious orders of priests and monks, as also calimancoes,
tabinets, brocaded satins, florettes, and damasks, of which the
legends of our grandmothers, and occasionally their wardrobes,
bear trace; crape, the celebrated Norwich crape, now almost a
forgotten fabric, was of later invention; but its fame is
chronicled in Ministerial mandates during Walpole&rsquo;s
administration, 1721, when court mourning was ordered to consist
of nothing but that pre-eminent material.&nbsp; Long since, the
paramatta cloth has superseded both bombazine and Norwich crape;
nor must we be unmindful that this superfine invention owes its
origin to the skill and ingenuity of a manufacturer of the <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>same city.&nbsp; Shawls of every variety have held a
prominent place among the manufactures; indeed, may be considered
as nominally the staple produce of the Norwich looms, though in
reality such is not the fact, an infinite variety of materials,
bearing as many new and fashionable titles, being in truth the
result of the labour of its artisans, silk&mdash;satins,
brocades, alpaccas, bar&egrave;ges, and many more; and of late
years the shoe manufactory has so vastly increased, that it may
fairly take a place henceforth among the constituents of the
&ldquo;fame&rdquo; of the capital of Norfolk.&nbsp; It may not be
out of place here also to give some little sketch of the rise and
progress of that most important of all inventions and arts,
printing, in these particular parts,&mdash;more especially as
William Caxton, the first English printer, was one of the agents,
and a principal one, in opening the commerce between this country
and Flanders in 1464, when that port was appointed a staple for
English goods as well as Calais, a measure fraught with immense
advantages to the manufacturing districts of the country, and of
course pre-eminently to this city.&nbsp; When he, the
mercer&rsquo;s apprentice, first stamped the
&ldquo;merchants&rsquo; mark&rdquo; upon his master&rsquo;s
bales, he little thought that by this same process of stamping,
carried forward by the ingenuity of many men into a new art, the
whole aspect of the world&rsquo;s history would be changed.&nbsp;
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>The origin of these distinctive &ldquo;marks,&rdquo;
still to be seen engraved on brasses, painted in church windows,
and here and there carved on the doors and panels of old houses,
is about as obscure as most of the other customs of those
ages.&nbsp; They were undoubtedly used to distinguish the
property of one merchant from another; and if their owners gave
money towards the building or restoration of churches, their
marks were placed in the windows, in honour of their
liberality.&nbsp; Similar marks are to this day used by some of
the merchants of Oporto and Lisbon, stamped upon their pipes of
wine.&nbsp; Their forms seemed to depend on fancy, but a certain
geometrical precision pervaded all; sometimes they were composed
of a circle with a cross, or a shield with crosses laid over each
other, of angles of every possible direction grouped into a
figure, now and then the figure of a bird or animal added, but
each differing essentially from every other, that it may retain
its distinctive characteristics.&nbsp; Printing, however, though
introduced into this country by Caxton, was for some centuries
seldom, if ever, practised, save in London and the two
universities.&nbsp; To the Dutch and Walloons, who came over at
the invitation of Elizabeth, is ascribed its first introduction
in this city.&nbsp; In 1568, a Dutch metrical version of the
Psalms was issued from the press.&nbsp; No great progress,
however, would seem to have been made during the next century,
but in 1736 was printed <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>anonymously
the &ldquo;Records of Norwich,&rdquo; containing the monuments of
the cathedral, the bishops, the plagues, friars, martyrs,
hospitals, &amp;c., in two parts, price three halfpence each; and
in 1738, an &ldquo;Authentic History of the Ancient City of
Norwich, from its Foundation to its Present State, &amp;c. (the
like not extant), by Thomas Eldridge, T.C.N., printed for the
author in St. Gregory&rsquo;s ch. yd., where may be had neat
Jamaica rum, fine brandy, Geneva and cordial waters, all sorts of
superfine snuffs and tobaccos at the lowest price!!!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This work, the author presumes, from its bulk (thirty-two pages),
to be the &ldquo;<i>completest work ever yet
published</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas for the literature of the
day!&nbsp; From this period, however, Norwich kept pace with
other places; a newspaper had been established even earlier, a
quarto foolscap, at a penny a number.&nbsp; Among the
advertisements from this &ldquo;<i>Gazette</i>&rdquo; bearing
date July 16, 1709, are these&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is to give notice to all persons in
the city, that right over against the three Feathers in St.
Peter&rsquo;s of Hungate, there is one lately come from London,
who teacheth all sorts of Pastry and Cookery, all sorts of
jellies, creams, and pickles, also all sorts of Collering and
Potting, and to make rich cakes of all sorts, and everything of
that nature.&nbsp; She teaches for a crown down, and a crown when
they are fully learned, that her teaching so cheap may encourage
very many to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Lynn, May 18, 1709.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crossgrove,</p>
<p>Did the Apostles use notes when they preached?&nbsp; I have
sent this Query twice before, and if I do not find it answered in
your next paper, I shall conclude you either cannot or durst not
answer it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours unknown, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p>I have a bushel of letters by me that came all to the same
tune with this of yours, viz. <i>You cannot or durst not answer
it</i>; but sometimes they see I dare do it, tho&rsquo; I neglect
other letters more pertinent through want of room: I have a dozen
letters come in a week, all post haste for an answer, and seldom
room to insert more than one at a time, so that many must of
necessity lye by.&nbsp; But now for your dreadful puzzling
question, Did the Apostles use notes? and to this I answer
positively <i>No</i>, nor Bibles neither to hide their notes in;
take notice of that; nor had they pulpits to stand in as ever I
heard of, and we may observe from their sermons they took no
texts: and what then?&nbsp; What would you infer from all
this?&nbsp; The Apostles also never studied their sermons, for
they had an extraordinary gift of preaching, as well as of
speaking.&nbsp; But I shall say no more to your designing
question than this&mdash;That those divines who read their
sermons know how to improve their time much better than in
getting them like schoolboys by heart; and that a good polite
discourse well read, is more worthy than a Bundle of what comes
uppermost tumbled out Head and Heels.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours, H. C.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well done, Mr. Crossgrove! say we.</p>
<p>In 1714, a &ldquo;Courant&rdquo; was established, small folio
size: at the end of one occurs this notice&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>&ldquo;Note.&nbsp; An Accident
happening, the reader is desired to pardon all <i>literal</i>
errors, as it is not corrected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Papers of somewhat later date afford samples almost as
quaint:&mdash;Advertisement.&nbsp; &ldquo;James Hardy acquaints
his friends, that he has lately had a large quantity of
preserves.&nbsp; I shall be very happy to supply any gentleman
with coals.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Notice is hereby given that on
Thursday and Friday next, being sixth and seventh of June, 1734,
a coach and horses will set out for London, from Mr. Thomas
Bateman&rsquo;s, St. Giles, and perform the same in three
days.&nbsp; Note, the coach will go either by Newmarket or
Ipswich, as the passengers shall agree.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
certainly had <i>one</i> advantage over railway travellers of the
present day&mdash;that they could choose their own route.</p>
<p>Another specimen runs&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas Mrs. Cooke at the
pastry shop near the three steps has charged Mrs. Havers with
embezzling to the quantity of two yards of padashway, out of her
suit of clothes turned upside down two years since, and made at
first for a much less person; the clothes having been viewed by
several mantua makers, the same appears to be a most malicious
slander,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Specimens might be multiplied, but these may suffice to place
beside the elaborate and ornate productions of this present year
1853, to see what a century has done in orthography, etymology,
syntax, and prosody.</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>It must have been rather more than twenty years after
the first establishment of a local newspaper, that the Rev.
Francis Blomefield, the great historian of the county, first
commenced printing his elaborate &ldquo;Topographical
Essay,&rdquo; a work of five volumes folio, the materials for
which he is said to have begun to collect when only fifteen years
of age.&nbsp; Many beyond the limits of the locality more
especially intended to profit by this laborious undertaking, may
feel interested in the facts connected with its progress,
contributing so much as they do to give a correct idea of the
difficulties attending the path of an author little more than a
century ago.</p>
<p>Blomefield was rector of the parish of Fersfield, in which
also he was born; in the summer months he was in the habit of
making excursions in search of materials for his work, and to
test the accuracy of information he had gained, by a method he
had adopted, in furtherance of his object, of distributing
&ldquo;queries,&rdquo; to be filled up with answers concerning
any historical or antiquarian subjects that may be known to the
parties applied to.&nbsp; In reference to this plan, he says
himself, in a letter to a friend, &ldquo;It is impossible to tell
you what great helps have come in by my queries: sometimes having
twenty or thirty sheets, besides books, letters, records and
papers for a single hundred;&rdquo; (alluding to the divisions of
the county into hundreds).</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>It was after one of his collating rambles that he
finally determined to issue proposals for printing his work; and
meeting with much encouragement, he speedily looked about for a
suitable printing establishment.&nbsp; In a letter to Mr. Chase,
a printer who lived next door to &ldquo;John o&rsquo; all
sorts,&rdquo; Cockey Lane, Norwich, on the 1st of July, 1733, he
says, &ldquo;I have endeavoured to procure a set of Saxon types,
but cannot do it; and upon looking over my book find a good
number of Greek inscriptions, some Hebrew words, and some
Gothic.&nbsp; So that I must print it in London; it being
impossible to have those types any where in the country
(!).&nbsp; I wish heartily I could have done it with you; for I
like your terms, and could have been glad to have corrected the
press myself, which I then could easily have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually he decided upon printing the work upon his own
premises, and engaged a good workman, at a salary of &pound;40 a
year, bought a press for &pound;7, and fitted up a printing
office with all the requisite materials.&nbsp; The account in the
papers of the &ldquo;Arch&aelig;ological Society,&rdquo; goes on
to say, &ldquo;At that time, distance and difficulties of
intercourse made any want of punctuality most annoying, and the
plan of printing at home involved the necessity of a great
variety of type and other materials.&nbsp; Meanwhile type
founders, stationers, and engravers, were <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>but too
much given to weary him with delay, or to disgust him with
fraud.&nbsp; Beginning a correspondence with frankness and
civility, he often had to continue it, urging and reiterating
entreaties of attention&mdash;alternately coaxing compliance with
&lsquo;half a piece&rsquo; to drink his health and success to his
work, or with &lsquo;promise of making amends,&rsquo; or a
&lsquo;fowl at Christmas,&rsquo; or rebuking with reluctant
severity, resulting more from devotedness to his object, than
anger or bitterness.&nbsp; A facetious engraver, who was
introduced to him, and invited to his house to assist him, after
remaining there three weeks, agreed for a large portion of the
work, and cut several of the things, all which he ran away
with.&nbsp; Other vexations sprang out of the patronage and
assistance he most valued; but, after many interruptions, the
first edition of a part of the book was brought out in
1736.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of his labours, however, he was cut off by that
virulent enemy, the small pox, on the 15th January, 1751, at the
age of forty-six.&nbsp; His work was continued by the Rev.
Charles Parkens, of whom a curious anecdote is related;&mdash;its
accuracy we do not pretend to vouch; the tale runs that Mr.
Parkens had a tame magpie, which had access to her master&rsquo;s
study, and seeing him busily employed in folding and unfolding
the packets that lay before him on his desk, she thought it no
harm to be busy too, until from time to time she flew away
<i>with the </i><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span><i>whole borough of
Yarmouth</i>.&nbsp; Many of the parcels, it is added, were
recovered, but others irrecoverably lost.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know not how the truth may be,<br />
But tell the tale as &rsquo;twas told to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this cursory glance at the work of the great historian of
the district, we close our chapter on the subjects suggested by
the &ldquo;Old Market-place.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sketches have been
necessarily superficial, but they afford proof that its
chronicles include a variety of matter and incident that may
interest almost every class of mind.</p>

<p>Our rambles have now brought us to the threshold of that
quaint, but beautiful old &ldquo;studwork&rdquo; chamber, the
guildhall; the seat of civic honour, power, and glory, with its
many appendages of courts and cells, the witnesses of those
multiplied alternations of tragedy, comedy, and melodrama, that
may be looked for to have been enacted during centuries, beneath
a roof covering a council chamber, an assize court, and a
prison.&nbsp; Once again, we avow that we aim not to be complete
topographers, or guides to all the strange old carvings, and
grotesque remains of ancient sculpture, that may be found in such
rich abundance around the pathways of a venerable city, neither
do we profess to furnish all the historic details <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>that may be gleaned concerning these relics of
antiquity; are they not chronicled elsewhere, in many mighty
tomes, readable and unreadable, in &ldquo;guides,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tours,&rdquo; and manifold
&ldquo;directories?&rdquo;&nbsp; We look and think, and odd
associations weave our thinkings sometimes, perhaps, into a queer
mottled garb, though we would solemnly aver the woof through
which the shuttle of our fancy plays is every fibre of it
truth.</p>
<p>Such a preface is needed to our sketch of this fine old
ornament of the city&rsquo;s market-place, lest disappointment
should attend the hopes of the inquisitive investigator of sights
and relics.</p>
<p>The guildhall, once like the municipal body it represents, was
but a tiny little thing compared with what it since has grown,
and when bailiffs and burgesses were the only distinctive titles
and offices, a simple chamber thatched, and commonly used to
collect the market dues, sufficed for the seat of civic
government; but when, in the reign of the third Henry, the
citizens received from him a charter for a mayor and sheriffs,
they took off the thatched roof of their little toll-booth, and
built upon it, and round about it, spacious rooms and courts, to
accommodate and do honour to their newly acquired municipal
dignitaries; for which purpose a warrant was obtained, to press
all carpenters, builders, and bricklayers, into active service,
from eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning until <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>eight
o&rsquo;clock at night, as long as occasion might require; and by
such compulsory process, the design was completed some fifty
years from the date of its commencement.&nbsp; The tower, wherein
was the treasury, fell down in Bluff King Harry&rsquo;s reign,
whose matrimonial exploits have given him notoriety, in addition
to the grand event of history, the Reformation, with which they
bore so intimate a connection.&nbsp; Decay, renovation, change,
and reformation, have been so busy with this seat of government,
from the era of its infancy until the present time, that no small
degree of ingenuity must be needed to unravel the twistings and
turnings, and comprehend the inharmonious groupings that have
sprung up about it, the divers offsprings of various ages, that
mark the progress and growth of the municipal constitution.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the first claim to antiquity is justly assigned
to the lower dungeons and cells, some of which still serve as
<i>lock ups</i> for offenders awaiting magisterial examination;
and a remarkably unpleasant situation must the individual find
himself in, who is there for ever so brief a space in
&ldquo;durance vile;&rdquo; the convicted transgressor certainly
makes an exchange for the better, when he reaches his ultimate
destination, the city prison cell; dark, damp, underground
coal-cellars, may be deemed <i>fair</i> illustrations of the
accommodation there offered to those whom the &ldquo;<i>law deems
innocent</i>&rdquo;, as it professes to <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>do all
unconvicted persons.&nbsp; One degree darker, and more horrible,
are the <i>dungeons</i>, which receive no light whatever, save
from a jet of gas without the gratings of the doors; into these
refractory guests are stowed, that their rebellious sounds may
not disturb the ears of any passers-by above ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deeper, and deeper still,&rdquo; down beneath the very
foundations of the building, at the foot of a dark narrow winding
stair, fast crumbling to decay, is yet another dungeon, long
since closed for any practical purposes; the eye of curiosity
alone happily is permitted to penetrate its depths.&nbsp; Dark
and damp, however, as it is, it would seem preferable to the
dismal &ldquo;<i>lock ups</i>,&rdquo; a light, of modern
introduction, from the street above, giving it a less intensely
black look.&nbsp; Here it was that poor old Bilney spent his last
hours of life; and the groined and vaulted roof, constructed upon
the plan of so many of the cellars of that period of civil and
domestic architecture, gives to the place a strangely
ecclesiastical look in these days, and imagination has little
difficulty in calling up the priest of the subterranean temple,
who has been pictured to our eyes as there testing the powers of
his endurance, by holding his finger in the lighted flame of the
candle, to satisfy his friends that he should not shrink from the
bodily pangs that were on the morrow to earn for him the crown of
martyrdom.&nbsp; Solemn and sad are the memories clustered <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>around these dreary tombs of liberty, nor is their
atmosphere tempting to linger in, even upon a visit of
curiosity.</p>
<p>The winding stair from <i>the dungeon</i> leads into what is
now a porch-way, but which must once have been the site of the
old chapel, built for the use of the prisoners.&nbsp; This chapel
was dedicated to St. Barbara, the prisoner&rsquo;s saint, who,
according to the legend of the Romish church, &ldquo;was
imprisoned by her father, in a high strong tower, to the end that
no man should behold her,&rdquo; and therefore St. Barbara is
always represented with a tower.&nbsp; She is commemorated on the
fourth of December, as St. Barbara, the Virgin and Martyr.&nbsp;
Here, were formerly kept all the goods and chattels appertaining
to the mayorality and civic feasts, in addition to the services
belonging to the chapel itself; but about the era of the
Reformation the chapel was pulled down, to make way for secular
offices.&nbsp; How busy those good reformers were in abolishing
every place dedicated to worship, that their judgment deemed
supernumerary!&nbsp; When the treasury tower fell in, it crushed
a prison, known by the name of &ldquo;<i>Little Ease</i>;&rdquo;
the full details of whose attractions we are left in ignorance
of.&nbsp; Upon the first floor, near the site of the chapel, was
once the large chamber, where the sealing of the cloths
manufactured in the city was carried on, since converted into an
assize court, <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>where the notorious lawmongers of
this city, with their brother dignitaries of the bar, join forces
to promote the ends of justice, their clients, and their
own.&nbsp; There is a queer old document extant, wherein the
number of learned gentlemen permitted to follow the profession of
the law in this city was limited, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as the
preamble states, &ldquo;when there were no more than six or eight
attorneys at the most coming to the king&rsquo;s courts, great
tranquillity reigned in the city and county, and little trouble
or vexation was made by untrue and foreign suits; and now, so it
is, that in the said city and county there be fourscore
attornies, or more, the more part having nothing to live upon but
only his gain by the practice of attorneyship, and also the more
part of them not being of sufficient knowledge to be an attorney,
&amp;c. &amp;c., whereby proceed many suits more of evil will and
malice than of the truth of the thing, to the manifold vexations,
and no little damage of the inhabitants of the said city and
county.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wherefore it was enacted, that there should
be but six attorneys in the county, and two in the city, for the
future.&nbsp; When this admirable statute was repealed, we know
not, but conceive it must have been long, long ago, for so many
brass-plate signs to have sprung up in evidence of a numerous
progeny taking place of the solitary two.&nbsp; Whether the
repeal was a <i>reform</i> calculated to benefit the city,
experience best can <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>prove; but if the character of the
&ldquo;common folk&rdquo; in these parts is faithfully given by
the author of &ldquo;English Worthies,&rdquo; we may presume them
to have been considerably inconvenienced by the scarcity of tools
with which to play their favourite game.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;that the common folks of Norfolk are possessed of such
skill in the law, that they are said to study the law at the
plough&rsquo;s tail, and some would persuade us that they will
enter an action for their neighbour&rsquo;s horse only looking
over the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In later times, evidences of the law mania exist in manifold
forms; and the fact of individuals consulting a lawyer before
calling in a doctor, in physical ailments, is by no means an
uncommon occurrence among a certain class.&nbsp; Some men think
and judge with their lawyer&rsquo;s heads, who, in return, of
course, in justice live upon their purses.</p>
<p>Some few amusing facts connected with the boasted English
privilege of &ldquo;Trial by Jury,&rdquo; may serve to illustrate
the growth of &ldquo;purity&rdquo; in our courts of law.&nbsp;
The jurisdiction exercised over jurors by the
&ldquo;Star-chamber&rdquo; is a notorious matter of history; but
the curious and graphic description of the nature and
constitution of a jury in the thirteenth century, as given by Sir
Francis Palgrave, in his &ldquo;Tale of the Merchant and
Friar,&rdquo; may not be quite so familiar, and is far too good
to be omitted.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A trial was about to commence.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sheriff, is <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>your inquest in court?&rsquo; said
the Mayor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, my lord,&rsquo; replied the sheriff,
&lsquo;and, I am proud to say, it will be an excellent jury for
the crown.&nbsp; I myself have picked and chosen every man upon
the panel.&nbsp; I have spoken to them all; and there is not one
whom I have not examined carefully, not only as to his knowledge
of the offences of which the prisoner stands charged, but of all
the circumstances from which his guilt can be collected,
suspected, or inferred.&nbsp; All the jurors were acquainted with
him; eight out of the twelve have often been heard to declare
upon their oath, that they were sure one day he would come to the
gallows; and the remainder are fully of opinion that he deserves
the halter.&nbsp; My lord, I should ill have performed my duty,
if I should have allowed my bailiffs to summon the jury at
hap-hazard, and without previously ascertaining the extent of
their testimony.&nbsp; Some perhaps know more, and some less; but
the least informed of them have taken great pains to go up and
down every corner of Westminster, they and their wives, and to
know all that they could hear concerning his past and present
life and conversation.&nbsp; Never had any culprit a chance of a
fairer trial.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An extract from the archives of the Record room, gives another
specimen of the mode of dealing with jurymen, if they proved
refractory or obstinate.&nbsp; It bears the date of the 8th year
of King Henry VIII., <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>and is to the purport that the jury
that &ldquo;acquitted Walter, James, and John Doo, Benet Bullok,
and Edmund Stuttlie, notwithstanding that they had good and
substantial evidence given against the said felons, at the last
gaol delivery of Norwich; as the chief Justice of the
King&rsquo;s Bench, the Lord Edmund Howard, and William Ellis,
one of the justices of the peace there, openly declared before
the lords, in the presence of the said jury; for the which
perjury so by them committed, it is by the lords&rsquo; most
honourable council adjudged and decreed, that the said jury shall
do the penance following, that is to say, they shall be committed
to the Fleet, there to remain till to-morrow, and that then, at
six of the clock, they shall be brought by the warden of the
Fleet into Westminster Hall, with papers on their heads, whereon
shall be written in great letters, &lsquo;these men be wilfully
perjured;&rsquo; and with the same papers on their heads they
shall be led thrice about the hall of Westminster aforesaid, and
then to be led by the warden of the Fleet to the Fleet again,
there to remain till Monday; and on Monday, in the morning, to be
had into Cheapside, and there shall go about the cross in Chepe
thrice, and then they shall return to the Fleet, and there to
remain till Tuesday, and then to be brought again before the
lords, to be bound by recognizances to do the same penance at
home, in their county at Norwich; and that a precept <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>shall be directed to the mayor and sheriffs of the city
of Norwich aforesaid, to see the said parties do the said penance
in the said city, upon Saturday, the 22d day of this present
month of November, openly in the market-place there, with papers
on their heads, whereupon shall be written the same words above
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old mode of trial by ordeal, consisting as it did of an
appeal to Heaven for judgment, either directly by miraculous
interference, as in the ordeals of fire and water, or indirectly,
in the ordeals of single combat, might well have had their charms
in the memory of culprit and jurors both, when such a substitute
alone was offered by the courts of justice that had superseded
them.&nbsp; There are, however, two extremes that may be gone to
about every thing; and we believe a little wholesome penance
might, even in the nineteenth century, not come amiss to stir up
the wits of many a sleepy juror.&nbsp; Certes, they often richly
merit it.</p>
<p>From the assize court we bend our steps upward, to the region
where we may feel at no loss in our search for objects of genuine
antiquity, and find ourselves in the <i>Council Chamber</i>; and
here we arrive at the very pinnacle of magisterial
dignity&mdash;the zenith of municipal glory&mdash;the seat of
mayoralty and aldmermanship and common councilship, once broadly
separate and distinct in their grades of rank and <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>power, in very truth an upper and a lower house, a
peerage and a commons&mdash;assembling themselves in chambers
becomingly graduated in their degrees of splendour&mdash;but now,
alas! in these degenerate days of reformation and democratic
sovereignty, as some might please to call them, all merged into
one conglomerated body corporate&mdash;shall we add, of <i>order
Gothic composite</i>?</p>
<p>The old chamber looks as if it had seen better days; two or
three patched-up windows of variegated colours, still retaining
many quaint and curious devices, bear witness of the taste and
liberality of our forefathers; and imagination, by the aid of
history&rsquo;s pen, can fill up the unsophisticated plain glass
lights at the side, with the old subjects that once occupied
their space, but which have fallen a sacrifice to the
despoiler&rsquo;s barbarous hand;&mdash;one of the unjust judge,
who, being flayed alive, was succeeded in office by his son, and
the picture, so they tell us, was elucidated by some very
characteristic specimens of antique poetry&mdash;to wit, the
first two lines of general advice, addressed to all who may ever
be in a position to profit by it,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let alle men se, stedfast you be,<br />
Justice do ye, or else like you fle;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and an additional verse to the unfortunate son who succeeded
him in office:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You that sittyst now in place,<br />
See hange before thy face<br />
<!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Thyn own Fader&rsquo;s skyn,<br />
For falsehood; this ded he wyn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another equally original specimen of the judgment of Solomon
is thus explained:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The trewe and counterfeit to trye,<br />
She had rather lose her Ryght&mdash;<br />
Saying, the Soulders ware redy<br />
To clyve, with all their myght.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These, as I said, have disappeared; but we were unwilling in
our sketch to lose sight altogether of such very interesting
reliques of our ancestor&rsquo;s skill, in conveying moral
lessons by the light of their window-panes, as were to be found
here a century or two ago.&nbsp; Those good old folks did not
seem to be wanting in a certain kind of wit; here, as in many
other parts of the city, we have traces of their love of a fair
rebus&mdash;without a slight knowledge of which propensity, we
might look long ere we could understand the hieroglyphical
appearance of a barrel set on end, with <span class="smcap">N. E.
C.</span> written above&mdash;history, however, elucidates the
mystery, by explaining it as the rebus of one <span
class="smcap">Thos. Necton</span>, who aided by his wealth the
filling in of one of the little gothic windows with stained
glass.&nbsp; The curiously carved old desk in the centre was once
the reading-desk in fair St. Barbara&rsquo;s chapel down
below,&mdash;could it speak, we wonder whether it would glory in
its <i>elevation</i>.&nbsp; But now we really can resist no
longer a good hearty laugh <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>at those
comical little unmakeoutable animals, seated so demurely all
round the room, on the tops of the high-backed benches, with
their queer little faces struggling to keep down a grin.&nbsp;
Whatever were they put there for?&nbsp; Was it to chronicle up in
their little wooden pates the doings and undoings, the sayings
and unsayings, that they have been looking at, and listening to,
so patiently and wonderingly, for these four centuries
past?&nbsp; What would we give to hear them tell the tale of all
they have seen and heard go on, since first the royal charter
granted to our citizens the long-sought privilege of a real
<i>bona fide</i> mayor! how, at first this dignitary used to sit
in solemn majesty upon his throne of state, surrounded by his
aristocracy of chosen peers, deliberating gravely on the affairs
of their little state; how, reverently and orderly the
subordinate commons used to come into their presence at their
bidding, and do as they were told by the supreme authorities; and
how, as time and years passed, the heads of these same commons
began to lift themselves a little and a little higher, till they
really seemed as much <i>real men</i> as those who occupied the
chairs of state; how, when at last their struggles had gained the
great municipal reform, some sixteen years ago, they took their
seats in the very midst of the aldermanic autocrats, with all the
coolness of precocious intellect, usurping dignities reserved for
high-sounding names or well-lined <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>purses.&nbsp; Could they not tell a few more tales of
how the ethereal blue and whites,&mdash;remembering the day when
their opponents, clad in purple, numbered nine out of twelve of
the industrious nominees who were to choose their fellow-workers
in the field of city usefulness, had traded with their talents
till they had gained nine and thirty more purples to sit by their
side, and smile at the twelve blue-looking occupants of the
opposition benches,&mdash;did, in later times, effectually turn
the tables on the oppressors&rsquo; heads, and sit above them in
triumph, looking down on fallen greatness; how this revolution
had scarce become familiar to their little sapiencies, when from
the very centre of the rival factions sprang another party; and
the dogs, and dragons, and what-nots, felt ready to jump from
their seats, when their ears heard a city youth avow himself an
independent man, neither a <i>blue</i> nor <i>purple</i>&mdash;a
man of <i>principle</i>&mdash;didn&rsquo;t they wonder what it
meant, and whether he really had enough of it to buy up both the
other bidders in this marketable borough, or whether it would pay
the interest of all the sums that they had severally spent in the
good city&rsquo;s cause, and how they longed to laugh outright
when he avowed that honesty and truth were all the
<i>principal</i> he traded with, and how they began by-and-bye to
think there might be something in it, and to comprehend a little
of the theory, but somehow <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>the working
of it seemed to puzzle and perplex them, it seemed to be so
complicated by the interference of expediency.&nbsp; But it will
not do to tarry longer, conjecturing what might be the
confessions of the little carved images; who does not, or has not
read the brilliant comedies that have been, and are yet being,
enacted perpetually within this chamber?</p>
<p>But there are more objects of interest to be examined within
its walls; and among them pre-eminently stands forth the sword of
Admiral Don Xavier Francisco Winthuysen, transmitted by Horatio
Nelson to the mayor of the city, from the Irresistible, off
Lisbon, Feb. 26th, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1797.&nbsp;
The sword, with its white vellum sheath ornamented with silver,
is enclosed in a glass case, with the original letter from
Admiral Nelson, relating the particulars of its capture.&nbsp; In
these days of railways and universal travelling, the trophy might
prudently, we conceive, hold less conspicuous place.&nbsp; No
great stretch of the bounds of probability might suggest the
chance of some relative or descendant of Don Xavier Francisco
standing face to face with the uncomfortable memento of past
misfortunes.&nbsp; Leading from this chamber is a door-way, that
opens out upon leads, where in olden times the ladies and friends
of the aldermen were wont to enjoy the various spectacles offered
by the processions and pageants then so frequently displayed.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>The other principal chamber, formerly used by the
common-councilmen, and now appropriated to sundry legal purposes,
is adorned with the various quaint and significant emblems that
once figured in the guild processions, in attendance upon his
majesty, Snap, who, from the dignity of his elevation upon the
landing-place without, looks down with proud and silent scorn
upon all the modern innovations and reformations that have swept
away the glories that surrounded his throne;&mdash;but of him
more by-and-bye.</p>
<p>Beyond the council-chamber is the way of access to the old
Record room, whence, now and then, some &ldquo;Old
Mortality&rdquo; may be seen emerging, laden with treasures
rescued from the mouldering heaps of antiquarian lore, there
lying buried beneath the accumulated dust and cobwebs of
centuries.&nbsp; All praise and thanks be given, as due, to these
patient and industrious workers, the fruits of whose labours so
liberally are placed at the command of all less learned and
recondite scribblers, who scruple not to gather of the crumbs
that fall from the rich intellectual banquets they have spread
before the lovers of history, antiquity, or science.</p>
<p>An armoury room, where weapons of divers sorts and multiform
invention are stored, all bearing evidence of long disuse by rust
and decay, and a treasury of gold and silver, maces and sceptres,
in <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>their various departments, claim notice; but as such
things possess neither very great intrinsic worth, or any
peculiarly interesting historical interest, save the little
sceptre of Queen Elizabeth, a passing word may be enough to
devote to them; it is time to turn attention to the subject more
intimately associated with the very name of the building
itself.&nbsp; A Guildhall instantly suggests the question of
guilds, their origin, character, and the features of history
connected with those whose existence are memorialized by this
particular edifice and its appendages.</p>
<p>Guilds were societies of persons confederated together for the
common cause of trade, charity, and religion.&nbsp; They were
very numerous; in this county alone 907 were enumerated by Taylor
in his Index Monasticus, as existing at the time of the
Reformation.</p>
<p>The Parochial guilds were often too poor to afford to hire a
room for their meetings, but assembled at each other&rsquo;s
houses; but when such was not the case, they usually hired a
house near the church, which was called a Guildhall, or church
house; the situation being chosen as convenient, their business
being to pray as well as to eat.&nbsp; The Guild consisted of an
alderman, brethren and sisters, the parson of the parish and the
principal persons of the neighbourhood being members.&nbsp; They
held lands, received legacies, and frequently met; but their
grand assembly was on the <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>day of
their patron saint, when they went to church and offered up
prayers at his altar for all the members of the society, living
and dead.&nbsp; From their saint they took their distinctive
titles, as St. George&rsquo;s, St. Luke&rsquo;s Guild,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They bestowed alms annually upon the poor, received
travelling strangers, and did other acts of charity, as far as
their revenues allowed.</p>
<p>Their meetings were usually crowned by a dinner, and
terminated often in a manner not altogether consistent with their
commencement.&nbsp; Some of the guilds in large towns were
wealthy and influential.&nbsp; The bill for giving their
possessions to the king, when sent to the lower house in 1547,
was much opposed by the burgesses, who represented that the
boroughs could no longer maintain their churches and other public
works, if the rents belonging to the guilds were transferred to
the king.&nbsp; The act passed, upon a pledge that the lands
should be restored.&nbsp; It was the last act of Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s reign, and was put in execution by his successor;
but the promise was ill performed, many of the revenues being
seized, upon the plea of their being free chapel or chantry
endowments.</p>
<p>This brief sketch of the nature and origin of guilds, may
suffice to introduce more particularly the history of the great
Guild of St. George, the most important of all the fraternities
that existed in this city, and from being connected with the
municipal <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>body from an early date, intimately
associated with the history of the Guildhall.&nbsp; The following
copious account of the company, with the copy of one of the
charters granted to them, is extracted from the papers of the
Norfolk and Norwich Arch&aelig;ological Society.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>&ldquo;Henry, by the grace of God, (King) of England, France,
and lord of Ireland, &amp;c., to whom these present letters shall
come greeting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know ye that, whereas we have understood a certain
Fraternity, and Gild of the glorious martyr St. George, in our
city of Norwich, for thirty years past, and more, continually
have been, and are, still honestly governed, and the brethren and
sisters of the Gylde aforesaid, for the same time have found a
chaplain duly celebrating divine service in the Cathedral church
of the said city, and diverse and great cost for the worship of
God, and the same glorious martyr, have made and do purpose to do
more, if we should vouchsafe to assist them in the behalf.&nbsp;
Wee, in consideration of the premises, and for the augmentation
of the same of our people, to the said glorious martyr, do, for
us, our heirs (as much as in us lye), accept, ratify, and confirm
the said Fraternity and Gylde, and we have granted that the said
Fraternity and Gylde be perpetually a <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>community
in time succession for ever.&nbsp; And that the Fraternity and
Gylde aforesaid have the name of the Gylde of Saint George in
Norwich, for ever.&nbsp; And that the brethren and sisters
aforesaid, and their successors yearly by themselves, at their
will choose and create one alderman and two masters successively,
and make honest and reasonable ordinances and constitutions to
the better government of the said Fraternity and Gylde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also cloath themselves with one suit of cloaths, and
yearly make a feast for eating and drinking, in a convenient
place within the said city, to be by them assigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And also the aldermen and masters, brethren and sisters
of the Fraternity and Gylde aforesaid, and their successors, be
able and capable persons to purchase land, tenements, rents and
services, to have, receive, and hold to them and their successors
for ever, to the aldermen, masters, brothers and sisters of the
Gyld of St. George in Norwich; and may in all courts and places
for ever sue and be sued, answer and be answered, and gain and
lose, and have a common seal for the business of the Fraternity
and Gylde aforesaid to be transacted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And further of our special favour we have granted and
given license for us and our heirs, (as much as in us lyes), to
the aforesaid alderman, masters, brethren and sisters, that they
and their <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>successors may purchase and hold to
them and their successors lands and tenements, rents and
services, within the said city aforesaid, up to the value of ten
pounds, which are held of us in burgage, as well for the support
of one chaplain to celebrate divine service dayly in the church
aforesaid, to pray for us and the said brethren and sisters,
their healthful state while we shall live, and for our souls, and
the souls of the said brethren and sisters when we shall
die.&nbsp; And also for the sowlles of our renowned ancestors,
and of all the faithful deceased, as for the support of the
Fraternity and Gylde aforesaid.&nbsp; And other works and charges
of piety made thereof, according to the ordinances of the same
alderman, brethren and sisters for ever; the statute made against
giving lands or tenements in mortmain, or any other statute or
ordinance made to the contrary, or for that the then lands and
tenements aforesaid are held of us in burgage
notwithstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And moreover, to the setting aside the maintenance,
confederacy, and conspiracy which by means of the Fraternity and
Gylde aforesaid we have granted to the prior of the church
aforesaid and to the mayor and to the sheriffs of the said city;
also to the alderman and Fraternity of the Gylde aforesaid, which
shall be for the time being, sufficient power and authority of
expelling, discarding and removing according to their discretion,
all brethren and sisters <!-- page 200--><a

Fraternity and Gylde, aforesaid, from the Fraternity and Gylde,
and from all the benefits and franchises thereof for ever, who
shall be the cause of supporting or upholding such like
maintenance, confederacy, or conspiracy aforesaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In testimony whereof, we have caused these letters to
be made patent.&nbsp; Witness myself at Reading, the ninth day of
May, in the fifth year of our reign, by the King himself, and for

<p>Another charter of much greater length is still extant; but we
pass on to the next important feature in the history of the
society,&mdash;its union with the corporate body of the
city,&mdash;set forth in a voluminous indenture, known as Judge
Yelverton&rsquo;s mediation, which we transcribe, adapting the
orthography to suit the general readers of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Mayor, Sheriffs, and Commonality of the
City first united to the Fraternity of the Gylde of St. George,
by the mediation of</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Judge
Yelverton</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This writing indented, made the 27th day of March, the
year of the reign of King Henry VI. the 30th, betwixt the mayor,
sheriffs, and commonality of the city of Norwich, on the one
part, and the <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>alderman and brethren of the gylde
of the glorious martyr, St. George, of the said city, of the
other part, by the mediation and diligency of William Yelverton,
Justice of our Lord the King, of his own place.&nbsp; Witnesseth
that, as well the said mayor, sheriffs, and commonality, as the
aforesaid aldermen and brethren of the said gylde, both according
of all matters had or moved betwixt them, before this in manner
and form, as in the articles hereafter shewing:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, for to begin to the worship of God, our Lady,
and of the glorious martyr, St. George, forasmuch as the
Cathedral church of the Holy Trinity, of Norwich, is the most
worshipful and convenient place, that the glorious martys, St.
George, be worshipped by the aldermen and brethren of the said
guild, that therefore in the said place, after the forms and
effect of the old use had afore this time, the said alderman and
brethren be there on the feast of St. George, or some other day
in the manner accustomed, there to hear the first even-song, and
on the morrow following, to go in procession and hear mass, and
offer there in the worship of God and the said martyr; and also
there for to hear the second even-song and placebo, and dirige,
for the brethren and sisters&rsquo; souls of the said guild; and
on the day next following be at the mass of requiem, and offer
there for the souls of all the brethren and sisters of the said
guild <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>and all Christians; and that a
priest be continued there in the form accustomed, for to sing and
pray for the prosperity, welfare, and honourable estate of the
most Christian prince, King Henry VI., our sovereign lord, and
also for the welfare of William Yelverton, Justice, by whose
mediation and diligence the said accord and appointments have
been advised and engrossed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, for the welfare of all the brethren and
sisters of the said guild and fraternity living, and also for the
souls of King Henry V., first founder of the said guild, and for
all other souls of all the brethren and sisters of the said
guild, that be passed out of the world, and all Christian souls;
and if ever afterwards the possessions of the said guild will
stretch to sustain and find another priest, that then such priest
shall be found for to pray in like form, and that poor men and
women of the said guild be found and relieved by the said guild,
as hath been accustomed, as the goods will stretch to save other
charges and necessary expenses, to the worship of God and of the
said martyr, and to the good conservation and continuance of the
said brethren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, on the morning next after the solemnity of the
said guild, kept in the worship of the glorious martyr, Saint
George, the brethren of the said guild, and their successors,
shall yearly choose the mayor of the said city, and that time
being a brother of the <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>said guild,
for to be alderman of the said guild for all the next year
following, after his discharge of his office of mayoralty, then
forthwith to take the charge and occupation of the said office of
aldermanship of the said fraternity and guild; and so every
person chosen to be mayor yearly, after he hath occupied
mayoralty for an whole year, to occupy the said aldermanship of
the said guild; and in case he refuse to occupy the said
aldermanship after his mayoralty, to pay unto the said fraternity
100<i>s.</i> to the use of the said guild, and that the old
alderman stand still alderman, unto the time another be chosen
unto the said office of alderman to the said guild; and if the
alderman of the said guild happen to die within the year, that
then the mayor for the time being, occupy that office of alderman
for his time, and so forth the next year following, according to
this act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that all the aldermen of the said city, that now
are, and shall be in time coming, shall be made brethren of the
said guild, without charge of the feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that every man that is, or shall be chosen to be,
of the common council of the said city, be admitted also to be a
brother of the said guild if he like; and that by great diligence
and deliberation had, as well for the worship of the said city as
the said guild, that no man be chosen to the said common <!--

204</span>council, but such as are and seem for to be able and
sufficient of discretion and good disposition, and that every man
that shall be received a brother into the said guild, shall be
sworn, and receive his oath in form that followeth:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This hear, ye alderman and brethren of this
fraternity and guild of the glorious martyr, St. George, in this
city of Norwich, that from this day forward, the honour,
prosperity, worships, profits, welfare, and surety of the
fraternity and guild, after my power, I shall sustain, lawfully
maintain and defend, and all lawful ordinances made or to be
made, with all the circumstances and dependancies thereto
belonging, truly and duly pay my dues after the said ordinances,
without trouble or grievance of the said brethren and sisters, or
of any officer of them, and Buxum to you aldermen and all your
successors in all lawful commandments, to my power and cunning,
so that this oath stretch not to any thing against the laws of
God, nor against the laws of the land, nor against the liberties
or franchises, the welfare, good peace, and rest of this city,
nor against any panel of the oath that I have made afore to the
king, and to the said city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, the said aldermen and common council of the
guild, shall choose when they list, from henceforward, other men
and women of the said city, beside the said alderman and common
council, such as <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>they may think convenient by their
discretion, and able thereto for to be brethren and sisters of
the said guild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that there be no man chosen nor received from
henceforth into the said guild, dwelling out of the said city,
but if he be a knight or a squire, or else notably known for a
gentleman of birth, or else that he be a person of great worship
by his virtue, and by his truth and great cunning, or be some
great notable means and cause of great worship, and yet that all
manner of thing that shall appertain to the governance of the
said guild, or to any possessions or goods thereof, or choosing
of any brother into the said guild, or correction of any default
done to any brother, or by any brother thereof, and all other
things that appertaineth to the rules of the said guild, or by
the more part of them dwelling within the said city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that all the possessions and moveable goods, that
now or hereafter shall appertain to the said guild, be all only
employed and applied to the worship of God and our Lady, and of
the glorious martyr, St. George, and to the worship of the
brethren of the said guild, and for the health of the souls of
all those that have been brethren and sisters of the said guild,
are and shall be in time coming, and in none otherwise; and
hereto every man be sworn at his coming in specially, that
henceforward shall be <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span

that he shall here do all that is in his power, and in no wise
give his assent nor his favour to the contrary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that every year be chosen surveyors, and such
convenient officers as shall be thought necessary by the
discretion of the aldermen and brethren of the said guild; and
that every year the said alderman and four brethren of the said
guild, whereof two be aldermen of the said city, be chosen for to
see a reckoning, and to know the disposition and governance of
all the possessions, moveables, and goods appertaining to the
said guild, and to make a writing of the estate thereof, and shew
that to the brethren of the said guild yearly, or else to a
certain number of brethren, resident in the said city thereto
named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, that every four years, once be given hoods or
liveries of suit to each of the brethren of the said guild, and
them honestly to be kept and worn to the worship of the glorious
martyr, St. George, and of the brotherhood, if it seemeth to the
said alderman and common council convenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, although the aldermen of the city, and every
person of common council of the same city, be brethren of the
same guild, yet if it happen that any of them, or any other
citizen or brother of the said guild, be discharged of his
aldermanship, or put out of the said common council, or
<i>discomynyd</i> against <!-- page 207--><a

for a great and notable cause against his worship, that then
forthwith he be discharged of the said guild; or else, whosoever
be once a brother of the said guild, that he be a brother still,
paying his duties, till he will wilfully serve his own discharge,
or else for notable causes be reasonably discharged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also it is ordained that the alderman and twenty of the
brethren, aforesaid, be for the assembly, and the common council
of the said guild, and that it needeth not to have no greater
number thereto; and that the alderman name thereof six, by his
oath, that he choose no person by no manner persuaded, nor
private means, nor for favour nor friendship of no person, nor of
no parties, but such as to his conscience are most indifferent
and best disposed, and best willed to the worship and welfare,
rest, peace, and profit of all the city, and the said guild; and
in like form, the six so chosen shall, by their taking the same
oath, choose six of such persons of the said guild, according to
their said oath; then the alderman, by his said oath, such other
two which be aldermen of the said guild, of which two of the
aldermen, and the more part of them, shall be and make the common
council, and the assembly of the said guild; and if any of them
should be warned to come to the said common council, if he then
be resident in the said city, and come not, but if he hath

said guild shall be seen by the aldermen, and the said common
council of the said guild, and all those that be good,
reasonable, and convenient to the worship of God, our Lady, and
the glorious martyr St. George, and to the weal and peace within
the said city, shall be kept, with reasonable additions put
thereto, if it need; and if any ambiguity or doubt hereafterwards
fall for the understanding or execution of the said article, in
case that the said alderman, and more part of the said common
council cannot accord therein, that then it be reformed and
determined by the advice of the said William Yelverton.</p>

be, do conspire or labour to attempt to do in any thing the
contrary of any of these appointments, or any other in time
coming, by the aldermen or more part of the common council to be
made, and that reasonably proved upon him before the said
alderman, and the more part of the said common council, that then
he be forthwith discharged of the said guild, and that notified
by the said alderman to the mayor, in the common council of the
said city, that then, it done, he be discharged of his liberties
and franchises of the said city, and unable ever to be citizen of
the said city, or brother of the said guild, and taken and had as
a forsworn man shamed and reproved, and <i>reune</i> in the pain

this indenture remaining towards the said mayor and commonality,
the alderman and brethren of the said fraternity and guild have
set their common seal; and to the other part of the said
indenture, abiding toward the said alderman and brethren of the

year aforesaid, in the time of the mayoralty of Ralph Segrim,

alderman of the aforesaid guild, according to the tenour of this
agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From thenceforth, the court of mayorality, justices,
alderman, sheriffs, and common councilmen, were admitted and
united to the fraternity of the glorious martyr St. George.&nbsp;
The rank and importance of the members of the society may be
inferred from the fact, of their admitting from the country none
beneath the rank of <i>notable gentlemen</i>.&nbsp; The union of
the two bodies took place fourteen years after the substitution
of mayor and sheriffs for bailiffs.&rdquo;</p>

Lord Bardolph, by him given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, one mass book, price twelve marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also it is ordained, that the procession be done in
copes, and all the brethren to have hoods of sanguine, and a reed
or wand in his hand; and persons chosen to be aldermen, that
every other of them have a red cope, and every one a white cope;
the next year shall be clad in scarlet gowns, and parti-coloured
hoods, scarlet and white damask, on the forfeiture of the payment

William&rsquo;s shrine) on St. George&rsquo;s day, by the rules
accustomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also that a priest be paid a salary, amounting to
eleven pounds ten shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Persons appointed to provide hoods for the aldermen and

hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manner of choosing persons to be members <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>of
the society, was thus, in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of
King Henry VIII.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mayor chose three persons for the
common council; the alderman chose three other persons for the
same; these six chose other six for the same; and these twelve
persons, with the advice of the four feast-makers, chose two
feast-makers for the next year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of King Henry VIII.,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1545, at the general dissolution
of the abbeys, monasteries, convents, friaries, &amp;c., the
large and beautiful nave of the church of the Black Friars was
converted into a common hall for the mayors, sheriffs, citizens,
and commonality, with all their guilds and fraternities, to meet
and hold their annual feasts in; but principally the guild of St.
George, who expended two hundred and ten pounds upon its
improvement at that time.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Upon inviting persons to the feast, which
was to be done by the surveyors at the Whitsun holidays, all that
promised to dine at the feast paid their money down to the
feast-maker beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first year of the reign of King Henry VI., all
fraternities, guilds, processions, &amp;c., being thought
useless, and tending to promote superstition, were set aside, and
by virtue of the act passed, judged and deemed in the actual
possession of the sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the third year of the reign of King Edward <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>VI., it was further enacted, and agreed, that the
twenty persons, hitherto known as the St. George&rsquo;s
assembly, should be henceforth called the assembly of the feast
of the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and common council of the city;
and twenty persons were appointed to manage the guild feast, now
called the feast of the mayor, sheriffs, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;
The feast-makers to provide a supper also on the guild-day
evening, and the ordering of the charge to be referred to the
mayor, sheriffs, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; In the fourth year of this
reign, the goods of the company were appraised, and valued at
&pound;7 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first year of the reign of Queen Mary, 1552, it
was agreed, that there should be neither George nor Margaret on
the next feast day in the procession; but the dragon to come and
show himself as in other years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;April 22d, second of Queen Mary, the laws since Henry
VIII. repealed, and the guild to be kept as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.D. 1561; cordwainers admitted to office.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Innumerable other entries betray the various changes of
arrangement and regulation; but we pass on to</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">the
manner of the procession on the guild-day</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the whole
body of the court, St. George&rsquo;s company, and the <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>livery, met at the new elect&rsquo;s, where they were
entertained with sugar rolls and sack; from whence they all
proceeded with the newly elected mayor to the old mayor&rsquo;s,
in this order; the court first, St. George&rsquo;s company next,
and the livery last.&nbsp; At the mayor&rsquo;s they had a
breakfast provided for them, of pasties and roast beef, and
boiled legs of mutton; from whence, in inverted order, (livery,
St. George&rsquo;s company, and court), they proceeded to the
Cathedral Church, where a sermon was preached, always by the
minister of the parish in which the mayor resided; and he was the
chaplain during the mayoralty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the sermon was ended, the court had their horses
taken, finely caparisoned, which they mounted; and at the
entrance into the Royal Free School, which was curiously adorned
with greens and flowers, in a bower, stood one of the lads
thereto belonging, who was ready against the new mayor should
come up, to address himself to him in an oration of Latin, as did
several others, in different places, on horseback.&nbsp; As the
court proceeded with their robes of justice, the alderman in
their scarlet, and the sheriffs in their violet gowns, with each
a white wand in his hand, with trumpet sounding, the city music
playing along the streets, with the standard of England carried
before them.&nbsp; Then followed St. George&rsquo;s standard and
company, supported by <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>very tall stout men, who had dresses
suitable and proper for them; in this manner they proceeded,
though but slowly, occasioned by their stopping several times in
different places, to hear the speeches which were then spoken by
the free-school boys, as before mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being arrived at the guildhall, in the market, the
new-elected mayor had his robe of justice put on him, the gold
chain placed about his neck, the key of the gates delivered to
him according to custom: he was then sworn; after which he
generally made a speech to the citizens.&nbsp; The whole body
then remounted their horses, and proceeded to the New Hall (or
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall) to the dinner.&nbsp; As soon as the
court and their ladies, with the rest of the company, were
seated, the dinner was served up first to the mayor&rsquo;s
table, next at St. George&rsquo;s, and then, as fast as they
could, all the rest of the tables were plentifully filled with
great variety of all kinds of good eatables, but little or no
butcher&rsquo;s meat, but as to pasties, tarts, pickles,
lobsters, salmon, sturgeon, hams, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and
pigeons, in great plenty, even to profusion; and these all served
up in order, and besides what beer every one chose to drink,
either small or strong, they had what quantity they pleased,
besides a bottle of wine, which every man had delivered to him to
drink after dinner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>As soon as dinner was over, St George&rsquo;s company
looked into their book to see for the names of such as were
eligible to be chosen as feast-makers; and when they had selected
four persons, they walked round the hall to look for them; and no
sooner was one of them espied, than he had a garland of roses and
greens thrown over his head, and was congratulated upon being
chosen as feast-maker for the next year.&nbsp; If any of the four
were absent, it sufficed to send the garland to them at their own
houses, to make the appointment sure.&nbsp; A pecuniary fine
attended a refusal to serve.</p>
<p>After the choice of feast-makers was over, the
&ldquo;banquets&rdquo; were given to the ladies, and it growing
towards evening the whole body rose from their seats and waited
upon the new mayor home, where all were again entertained with
sugar rolls and sack; and then concluded the day by seeing the
old mayor to his home, where they remained and drank as long as
it was proper.</p>
<p>The great guns were discharged many times during the day.</p>
<p>The whole street, sometimes the whole parish, in which the
mayor resided was decorated in the handsomest manner; the streets
were all strewn with rushes and planted with trees, variety of
&ldquo;garlands, ship, antients, and streamers in
abundance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The outside of the houses were hung with
tapestry and pictures.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>&ldquo;The dragon (carried by a man
in the body) gave great diversion to the common people; they
always seemed to fear it much when it was near them, but looked
upon it with pleasure when at a little distance; it was so
contrived as to spread its wings and move its head.&nbsp; As
there was always a multitude of people to see the procession, it
was necessary to have several persons to keep them from coming
too near, or breaking the ranks; for this purpose there were six
men called Whifflers, somewhat like the Roman gladiators, who
were neatly dressed, and who had the art of brandishing their
very sharp swords in the greatest crowds with such dexterity as
to harm no one, and of a sudden, to toss them high in the air and
catch them again by the hilts: to this purpose also a man or two
in painted canvas coats and vermilion red and yellow cloth caps,
adorned with cats&rsquo; tails and small bells, went up and down
to clear the way; their weapons were only small wands.&nbsp;
These were called or known by the name of Dick Fools; even they
had their admirers, but it was among the children and
mobility.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above curious and quaint description of the St.
George&rsquo;s Company and the procession, is an extract from
Mackerell&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Norwich,&rdquo; published by
the Arch&aelig;ological Society.&nbsp; From the same source the
further particulars added are collected.</p>
<p><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>It would appear that the company, enjoying so many
powers and privileges, grew insolent and overbearing, and were
wont to insult with impunity, and tyrannize unmercifully over the
pockets, purses, and freedom of their fellow-citizens, until at
length an individual named Clarke, an alderman, to whom they had
shown much discourtesy and injustice, by considerable effort
succeeded in bringing their career as a body to an end.&nbsp;
Their charter, books, regalia, and all that belonged to them were
given up to the Corporation, and arrangements made at the same
time for the mayor&rsquo;s procession and rejoicings upon a new
footing.&nbsp; The dragon, the fools, and whifflers, were
continued and paid by the Corporation, but instead of the St.
George&rsquo;s company, the sixty common councilmen attended upon
the newly elected mayor on horseback in their gowns.&nbsp; The
mayor was to make a guild feast at his own charge, &pound;150
being given him towards the expenses of his mayoralty.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus (using the words of the writer) fell
this honourable tyrannical company, who had lorded it over the
rest of the citizens, by laws of their own making, for an hundred
and fourscore years; had made all ranks of men submit to them;
neither had they any regard to the meanness of persons&rsquo;
circumstances, by which they had been the ruin of many families,
and had occasioned much rancour and uneasiness every annual
election of common-councilmen, <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>when the
conquerors always put the vanquished on to the livery; thereby
delivering them over to the mercy of St. George, who was sure to
have a pluck at them as they assembled and met together; until
this gentleman alderman Clarke had the courage to oppose and
withstand them; and having taken a great deal of pains and time,
at last effected this great work, and brought this insolent
company to a final period; for which good deed he ought to have
his name transmitted to the latest posterity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now it behoves us to inquire who was St. George?&nbsp;
Shall we be content to hear of his mighty prowess, his renowned
sanctity, and his eminent exaltation as patron saint of our
country, and the most famous guilds or fraternities that have
ever flourished in Christendom, and know nothing of his origin,
history, or reality?&nbsp; Shall we subscribe to the heretical
belief that St. George was neither more nor less than a soldier
in the army of Diocletian, who rewarded his great military
exploits by cutting off his head for advocating the cause of the
Christians, and that therefore he was elevated into the calendar
of saints and martyrs in the early church?&nbsp; Shall we deny
that he ever went to war with an insatiable dragon, who, having
eaten up all the sheep and cattle in the neighbourhood, was fed
upon fair youths and maidens &ldquo;from a city of Libya, called
Silene, and that he did mortally wound the said <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>dragon and led him through the streets of the
city,&rdquo; as if it had been a meek beast and debonnaire? or
shall we give ear to the suggestion that St. George is but
another name for St Michael, who is always represented in combat
with the dragon?&nbsp; To whatever belief we may incline, the
fact of the antiquity of his claims upon Christendom for
universal reverence cannot be disputed.&nbsp; Long before he
became the patron saint of England, many eastern nations had
adopted him in the same capacity; and to his personal and
miraculous interference in protecting Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion
in his conflict with Saladin, are we to attribute his elevation
to that dignity in this country?&nbsp; Many orders of knighthood
besides that of England have been distinguished by his name in
Austria, Bavaria, Burgundy, Montesa, Ravenna, Genoa, and
Rome.&nbsp; The most authentic accounts that have come down to us
of the individual history and mortal career of this semi-fabulous
personage, resolve themselves into a few leading facts.&nbsp; He
was a saint of high repute in the eastern church at a very early
date, a Cappadocian of good family, and a commander of note in
the army of Diocletian, and that he suffered martyrdom at Raniel,
on the 23d of April, the day on which his festival was
kept.&nbsp; He is mentioned in old Saxon homilies as an
ealder-man (or earl) of Cappadocia, and is mentioned in a MS.
Martyrologicum Saxonicum, in the library of <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge, as Georius Nobilis Martyr.&nbsp; The
Greeks called him the &ldquo;Great Martyr.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Coptic Arabic MSS. mention him as of Cappadocia; Constantine
instituted a religious order of knighthood, under the title of
St. George, on which was borne a red cross; he is also said to
have erected a church near his tomb in Palestine, and others in
his honour at Constantinople.&nbsp; The red cross, usually
attributed to St. George for an armorial bearing, was possibly
adopted from Constantine&rsquo;s order of knighthood.&nbsp; The
figure of the saint armed and on horseback, expresses his martial
character; and the dragon by many is conceived to be a symbol of
Paganism; the figure of the young lady sometimes introduced also
is regarded as a type of some city or province imploring aid, or
may possibly have been intended to memorialize the rescue of the
damsel, whom he is reported so gallantly to have saved from
destruction.&nbsp; There is a separate legend of a St. Margaret
and a dragon related by Mrs. Jameson, which says that the
governor of Antioch, captivated by the beauty of the fair
Margaret, who inclined not to his highness, shut her up in a
dungeon, and subjected her to all kinds of torments, and that
during her imprisonment the devil, in the form of a dragon,
appeared ready to devour her, but she held up the cross and he
fled.&nbsp; Many old prints represent the dragon lying peaceably
down, and Margaret with the cross standing by <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>unharmed.&nbsp; An old church at Canterbury is
dedicated to this Saint Margaret.&nbsp; Whether or not there
exists any connection between her and the heroine who usually is
associated with St. George, we know not.</p>
<p>We conclude this speculative inquiry with a curious extract
from a work by Dr. Sayer, a translation of a fragment annexed to
the Vatican MS. of Olfrid&rsquo;s Gospels, some say written in
the fourth century:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>George went to judgement<br />
With much honour<br />
From the market-place,<br />
And a great multitude following him,<br />
He proceeded to the Rhine <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a><br />
To perform the sacred duty,<br />
Which then was highly celebrated,<br />
And most acceptable to God.<br />
He quitted the kingdoms of the earth,<br />
And he obtained the kingdom of heaven.<br />
Thus did he do,<br />
The illustrious Count George,<br />
Then hastened all<br />
The kings who wished<br />
To see this man entering,<br />
(But) who did not wish to hear him.<br />
The spirit of George was there honoured,<br />
I speak truly from the report of these men,<br />
(For) he obtained<br />
What he sought from God.<br />
Thus did he,<br />
The Holy George.<br />
<!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Then they suddenly adjudged him<br />
To prison;<br />
Into which with him entered<br />
Two beautiful angels<br />
* * * * *<br />
Then he became glad<br />
When that sign was made (to him),<br />
George then prayed;<br />
My God granted every thing<br />
To the words of George;<br />
He made the dumb to speak,<br />
The deaf to hear,<br />
The blind to see,<br />
The lame to walk.<br />
* * * * *<br />
Then began the powerful man<br />
To be exceedingly enraged.<br />
Tatian wished<br />
To ridicule these miracles.<br />
He said that George<br />
Was an impostor;<br />
He commanded George to come forth;<br />
He ordered him to be unclothed;<br />
He ordered him to be violently beaten<br />
With a sword excessively sharp.<br />
All this I know to be altogether true;<br />
George then arose and recovered himself;<br />
He wished to preach to those present,<br />
And the Gentiles<br />
Placed George in a conspicuous situation,<br />
(Then) began that powerful man<br />
To be exceedingly enraged.<br />
He then ordered George to be bound<br />
To a wheel, and to be whirled round.<br />
I tell you what is fact;<br />
The wheels were broken to pieces,<br />
<!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>This I know to be altogether true;<br />
George then arose and recovered himself,<br />
He then wished (to preach); the Gentiles<br />
Placed George in a conspicuous place,<br />
Then he ordered George to be seized<br />
And commanded him to be violently scourged;<br />
Many desired that he should be beaten to pieces,<br />
Or be burnt to a powder;<br />
They at length thrust him into a well.<br />
There was this son of beatitude,<br />
Vast heaps of stones above him,<br />
Pressed him down;<br />
They took his acknowledgment;<br />
They ordered George to rise;<br />
He wrought many miracles,<br />
As in fact he always does.<br />
George rose and recovered himself.<br />
He wished to preach to those Gentiles,<br />
The Gentiles<br />
Placed George in a conspicuous place.<br />
* * * * *<br />
They ordered him to rise,<br />
They ordered him to proceed,<br />
They ordered him instantly to preach.<br />
Then he said,<br />
I am assisted by faith.<br />
(Then he said) when<br />
Ye renounce the devil<br />
Every moment * * *<br />
* * * * *<br />
This is what St. George himself may teach us.<br />
Then he was permitted to go into the chamber<br />
To the Queen;<br />
He began to teach her,<br />
She began to listen to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fragment ends here; the queen alluded to is <!-- page
226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>deemed to be the wife of Diocletian Alexandra, who has
been canonized by the Romish Church.&nbsp; She is said to have
been converted to Christianity, and suffered martyrdom with her
teacher.</p>
<p>We now beg to take leave of St. George and St. Margaret; Mr.
Snap or the Dragon in his coat of green and gold, at this present
surmounted by an outer coat of considerable thickness of dust,
must permit us to make our obeisance&mdash;trusting that the
gleanings we have made of all these little facts of history that
contributed to his importance in the day of his sovereignty and
splendour, may have gained for us a parting good will.</p>
<p>His days of pomp and majesty are ended&mdash;with the
banishment of fun and frolic, and folly, with the reformation of
councils and committees, of manners and municipalities&mdash;his
glory has departed, and but for the chronicles of the past, his
presence slumbering in oblivion, or in drooping despondency,
hanging his head in attitude of grief, might be a mystery
insoluble, as also might be the annual exhibition of the shabby
counterfeit presentment of his person in the shape of a cumbrous
imitation of himself, that is paraded once a year through street
and suburb, to keep alive the shadow of the memory of &ldquo;good
old times,&rdquo; in the hearts of the populace of a
pleasure-loving city&mdash;but a sorrowful and piteous spectacle
is this walking ghost of the <i>Snap</i> of the glorious guild of
St. George.</p>

<p>Among the many quaint specimens of the ways and doings of the
ancient respectable denizens of this present sober-minded city,
that have been rescued from the dim and dusty obscurity of the
municipal record chamber, has been found a curious minute of the
proceedings of a solemn court held on the Sabbath day of the
feast of St. Matthew the Apostle, in the nineteenth year of King
Henry VIII., when a petition was presented to the mayor, sheriffs
and common council of the city of Norwich, by the aldermen and
brethren of the guild of St. Luke, praying to be relieved from
the burthen of being sole purveyors of plays and pageants for the
people <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>on Whitsun Monday and Tuesday; and
it may safely serve as a text for a few rambling sketches of the
entertainments that were wont to gratify the taste of the lovers
of the drama, in the age before the stream of imperishable
philosophy had been poured forth from the waters of Avon, or its
banks had resounded to the harmony that was destined to sweep
over the length and breadth of the earth, vibrating through the
chords of every living heart that felt its breath.</p>
<p>Deep in the human mind lies the yearning for amusement, great
have been those who, laying hold of this inherent principle of
our nature, could make it a means for enlightening and ennobling
it; nor must we judge of the sincerity of the attempts that were
made in this work, by their impotency or failure.&nbsp; In dark
and barbarous times, what may seem gross buffoonery to our
refined senses, may have had power to convey a moral lesson or
excite a worthy impulse; and we may scarcely with any justice
withhold our meed of praise and admiration of the philosophy of
those old monks, who, seeing the immorality that characterized
the exhibitions provided by strolling players, jugglers,
tumblers, dancers, and jesters, journeying from town to town, and
castle to castle, and filling the large square court-yards
provided for their express accommodation by every house of any
pretensions to rank, set their <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>inventive
powers to work, to find a substitute for these recreations of
dubious tendency, and endeavoured to supersede the secular by the
religious drama.&nbsp; Appolonarius, and Gregory, Archbishop of
Constantinople, had done likewise, and dramatised scenes both
from the Old and New Testament, as substitutes for Euripides and
Sophocles, when the study of Greek philosophy was deemed heresy,
and to have read Virgil required from St. Augustine penitence and
prayer for pardon.&nbsp; Hence priests turned playwrights and
actors, and instead of profane mummeries presented scriptural
stories, or legendary tales, which they at least deemed improving
and instructive.&nbsp; Most old cities present traces, more or
less distinct, of these specimens of clerical ingenuity.</p>
<p>The Coventry and Chester mysteries have been preserved almost
entire; royalty honoured them with its presence, both in the
person of Richard III. and Henry VII. and his queen; York and
London have contributed their store of relics, and the
performances of the company of Clerks that gave the name to
far-famed Clerkenwell, and the fraternity of the Holy Trinity,
St. Botolph&rsquo;s Aldersgate, have become matters of
history.</p>
<p>We have to borrow light from these richer stores, to
comprehend the full meaning of the few traces left among our
chronicles, that bear evidence of similar practices in the other
localities; and here we <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>return to
the petition of the St. Luke&rsquo;s guild or fraternity.&nbsp;
Each branch of trade had then its company, or guild, and was
governed by laws of its own, under general supervision of the
municipal authorities.&nbsp; The St. Luke&rsquo;s guild was
composed of pewterers, braziers, bell-founders, plumbers,
glaziers, stainers, and other trades, and upon them it would seem
that the whole expense of the Whitsunside dramatic entertainments
had fallen; wherefore they besought their &ldquo;discreet
wisdoms&rdquo; to enact, and ordain, and establish, that every
occupation within the city, should yearly, at the procession on
Monday in Pentecost week, set forth one pageant, by their
&ldquo;discreet wisdoms&rdquo; to be assigned and appointed of
their costs and charges, which should be &ldquo;to the worship of
the city, profit of the citizens and inhabitants, and to the
great sustentation, comfort and relief as well of the said guild
and brethren of the same;&rdquo; which favourable aid should bind
them and their successors &ldquo;daily to pray to God for the
prosperities long to endure of their discreet wisdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which petition being heard and understood, it was agreed and
enacted that thenceforth every occupation in the said city should
find and set forth in the said procession one such pageant as
should be appointed by master mayor and his brethren
aldermen.&nbsp; In the same hand-writing as the minute to this
effect is a list of pageants, probably arranged in consequence of
it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These plays were performed on moveable
stages constructed for the purpose, described by Dugdale as
&lsquo;theatres very large and high, placed on wheels;&rsquo; and
Archdeacon Rogers, who died in 1595, and saw the Whitsun plays
performed at Chester, gives a <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>very minute
description of the mode in which they were exhibited: &lsquo;They
were divided there into twenty-four pageants, according to the
companies of the city; every company brought forth its
<i>pageant</i>, which was the carriage or stage in which they
played; these were wheeled about from street to street,
exchanging with each other, and repeating their several plays in
the different places appointed.&nbsp; The pageants, or carriages,
were high places made like two rooms, one above the other, open
at the top; the lower room was used as a dressing-room, the
higher room was the performing place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first of the Norwich pageants, the Creation of the World,
is similar to one described by Hone, as performed at Bamberg, in
Germany, so late as 1783; and its details so precisely accord
with the stage directions still extant of similar representations
in this country, that it has been adopted as a fair specimen of
the play alluded to in the list.</p>
<p>The description of the German representation is thus given in
the words of an eye-witness:&mdash;&ldquo;The end of a barn being
taken away, a dark hole appeared, hung with tapestry the wrong
side outwards; a curtain running along, and dividing the
middle.&nbsp; On this stage the Creation was performed.&nbsp; A
stupid-looking Capuchin personated the Creator.&nbsp; He entered
in a large full-bottomed wig, with a false beard, wearing over
the rusty dress of his order a brocade <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>morning-gown, the lining of light blue silk being
rendered visible occasionally by the pride the wearer took in
showing it; and he eyed his slippers with the same
satisfaction.&nbsp; He first came on, making his way through the
tapestry, groping about; and purposely running his head against
posts, exclaiming, with a sort of peevish authority, &lsquo;Let
there be light,&rsquo; at the same time pushing the tapestry
right and left, and disclosing a glimmer through linen clothes
from candles placed behind them.&nbsp; The creation of the sea
was represented by the pouring of water along the stage; and the
making of dry land by the throwing of mould.&nbsp; Angels were
personated by girls and young priests, habited in dresses (hired
from a masquerade shop), to which the wings of geese were
clumsily attached, near the shoulders.&nbsp; The angels actively
assisted the character in the flowered dressing-gown, in
producing the stars, moon, and sun.&nbsp; To represent winged
fowl, a number of cocks and hens were fluttered about; and for
other living creatures, some cattle were driven on the stage,
with a well-shod horse, and two pigs with rings in their
noses.&nbsp; Soon after, Adam appeared.&nbsp; He was a clumsy
fellow, in a strangely-shaped wig; and being closely clad with a
sort of coarse stocking, looked quite as grotesque as in the
worst of the old woodcuts, and something like Orson, but not so
decent.&nbsp; He stalked about, wondering at every thing, and
<!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>was followed from among the beasts by a large ugly
mastiff, with a brass collar on.&nbsp; When he reclined to sleep,
preparatory to the introduction of Eve, the mastiff lay down by
him.&nbsp; This occasioned some strife between the old man in
brocade, Adam, and the dog, who refused to quit his post; nor
would he move when the angels tried to whistle him off.&nbsp; The
performance proceeded to the supposed extraction of the rib from
the dog&rsquo;s master; which being brought forward and shewn to
the audience, was carried back to be succeeded by Eve, who, in
order to seem rising from Adam&rsquo;s side, was dragged up from
behind his back, through an ill-concealed and equally
ill-contrived trap-door, by the performer in brocade.&nbsp; As he
lifted her over, the dog, being trod upon, frightened her by a
sudden snap, so that she tumbled upon Adam.&nbsp; This obtained a
hearty kick from a clumsy angel to the dog, who consoled himself
by discovering the rib produced before, which, being a beef bone,
he tried his teeth upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second pageant was &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; provided by the
Grocers and Raffemen.&nbsp; In the Grocers&rsquo; books, now
lost, were the items of expenditure about this pageant, among
others, for painting clothes for Adam and Eve, &amp;c.&nbsp; In
the French collections, a legendary incident is introduced in
this play: When Adam attempts to swallow the apple, it will not
stir; and, according to the legend, this was the cause of the
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>lump in the man&rsquo;s throat, which has been
preserved ever since.</p>
<p>The third pageant, &ldquo;Hell Carte,&rdquo; was brought forth
by the Glaziers, &amp;c.&nbsp; One of a series of illuminated
drawings of the eleventh century, illustrative of the Old and New
Testaments, part of the Cottonian Library in the British Museum,
gives an idea of the manner in which this subject was
represented.&nbsp; By no very complex machinery, the huge painted
mouth was made to open and shut, and demons are represented
dragging into it a variety of classes of dishonest people;
thereby conveying a moral and satirical admonition against some
of the crying sins of the day, most practised among, and most
offensive to, the lower and middle classes of society.&nbsp; One
of these offenders was the ale-wife, who gave short
measure.&nbsp; In a <i>miserere</i> in Ludlow church, there is
set forth a demon carrying an ale-wife, with her false measure
and gay head-dress, to the mouth, while two other demons play on
the bagpipes, and read from a scroll the catalogue of her
sins.</p>
<p>The fourth pageant, &ldquo;Abel and Cain,&rdquo; was furnished
by the Sheremen, &amp;c.&nbsp; Disputes between Cain and his man
were comic scenes introduced into it, and formed its chief
attraction.</p>
<p>The fifth, &ldquo;Noyse Ship,&rdquo; was brought forth by the
Bakers.&nbsp; A fragment of a Newcastle play of the same name
affords a specimen of its probable character.&nbsp; <!-- page
237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>The <i>dramatis persona</i> are Noah, his wife, and
Diabolus; and a considerable portion of the play consists of
disputes between Noah and his wife, about entering the ark,
as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Noah</span>.</p>
<p>Good wife, doe now, as I thee bidd.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Noah&rsquo;s
Wife</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not I, ere I see more need,<br />
Though thou stande all day and stare.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Noah</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . that women ben crabbed be,<br />
And not are meek, I dare well say.<br />
That is well seen by me to-day,<br />
In witness of yet, eiehone.<br />
Good wife, let be all this beare,<br />
That thou mak&rsquo;st in this place here,<br />
For all they wene thou art master,<br />
And soe thou art by St. John.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further rebellion on the part of the spouse compels Noah to
carry out the threat,</p>
<blockquote><p>Bot as I have blys,<br />
I shall chastyse this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which she replies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet may ye mys<br />
Nicholle Nedy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He stops beating her, for the reason,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That my bak is nere in two.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which she adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And I am bet so blo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sixth pageant was Abraham and Isaac.&nbsp; Of <!-- page
238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>the details of this, and the seventh and eighth, no
records have been found.</p>
<p>The ninth&mdash;the birth of Christ, with shepherds, and the
three kings of Colen,&mdash;was a very common subject.&nbsp; The
scenes were, usually:&mdash;1st, Mary, Joseph, the child, an ox
and an ass, and angels speaking to shepherds.&mdash;2nd, The
shepherds speaking by turns, the star, an angel giving joy to the
shepherds.&mdash;3rd, The three kings coming from the East, Herod
asking about the child, with the son of Herod, two counsellors,
and a messenger.&mdash;4th, Mary, with the child and star above,
and the kings offering gifts.</p>
<p>In the Townley and Coventry Mysteries, the play commences with
a ranting speech of King Herod, one of those which gave rise to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s saying of &ldquo;out-heroding
Herod.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the fifth volume of the Paston Letters, J.
Wheatley writes to Sir J. Paston, &ldquo;and as for Haylesdon, my
lord of Suffolk was there on Wednesday; at his being there that
day, there was never no man that played <i>Herod</i> in Corpus
Christi better, and more agreeable to his pageant, than
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of these pageants were founded upon scripture narrative;
while of those of Coventry several are founded on legendary
history.</p>
<p>The tenth pageant, having for its object the &ldquo;Baptism of
Christ,&rdquo; was exhibited by the Barbers, &amp;c.</p>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>The eleventh pageant was the
&ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo; brought forward by the Butchers,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The twelfth and last pageant was the &ldquo;Holy Ghost,&rdquo;
and exhibited the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.</p>
<p>In the well-known mystery, entitled <i>Corpus Christi</i>, or
the Coventry play, the prologue is delivered by three persons,
who speak alternately, and are called <i>vexillators</i>; it
contains the arguments of the several <i>pageants</i> or
<i>acts</i> that constitute the piece, and they amount to no less
than forty, every one of which consists of a detached subject
from scripture, beginning with the Creation of the Universe, and
concluding with the &ldquo;Last Judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
first pageant or act, the Deity is represented seated on a throne
by himself; after a speech of some length, the angels enter,
singing from the church service portions of the Te Deum.&nbsp;
Lucifer then appears, and desires to know if the hymn was in
honour of God or himself, when a difference arises among the
angels, and the evil ones are with Lucifer expelled by force.</p>
<p>The Reformation had not the effect of annihilating these
observances in many places; the Corpus Christi procession was
kept up for years after, as in Norwich; and it was not until the
beginning of the reign of James I. that they were finally
suppressed in all the towns of the kingdom.</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>John Bale, of the Carmelite Monastery, of Whitefriars,
Norwich, afterwards a convert to Protestantism, and made
successively Bishop of Ossory, Archbishop of Dublin, also a
prebend of Canterbury, was a great writer of mysteries; one of
his compositions was entitled &ldquo;The Chief Promises of God to
Man,&rdquo; its principal characters being God, Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and John Baptist.</p>
<p>Moralities were of later date than mysteries, and differed
from them, as consisting of dramatic allegories, in which the
vices and virtues were personified; the province of exciting
laughter descended from the devil in the <i>mystery</i>, to
<i>vice</i> or <i>iniquity</i> in the <i>morality</i>, and was
personified by <i>pride</i> or <i>gluttony</i>, or any other evil
propensity; and even when regular tragedies and comedies came
upon the stage, we may trace the descendants of this line in the
clowns and fools who undertook this portion of the entertainment,
to the no small detriment of the more serious parts of the best
tragedies.&nbsp; In Hamlet&rsquo;s direction to the players,
allusion is made distinctly to this.&nbsp; The secular plays
which existed before mysteries were invented, differed very
materially from either them or moralities, and were far inferior
to them in refinement and delicacy; they retained their
popularity, however, notwithstanding their clerical rivals, and
the efforts that were diligently made to do away with them.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span><i>Interludes</i> were a variety of these secular
plays, and probably gave birth to the <i>farce</i> of later
times; they were facetious or satirical dialogues, calculated to
promote mirth.&nbsp; A representation of this character before
Henry the Eighth, at Greenwich, is thus related by
Hall:&mdash;&ldquo;Two persons played a dialogue, the effect
whereof was to declare whether riches were better than love; and
when they could not agree upon a conclusion, each knight called
in three knights well armed; three of them would have entered the
gate of the arch in the middle of the chamber, and the other
three resisted; and suddenly between the six knights, out of the
arch fell down a bar all gilt, for the which bar the six knights
did battle, and then they departed; then came in an old man with
a silver beard, and he concluded that love and riches both be
necessary for princes; that is to say, by love to be obeyed and
served, and with riches to reward his lovers and
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another is described by the same author as performed at
Windsor, when &ldquo;the Emperor Maximilian and King Henry, being
present, there was a disguising or play; the effect of it was,
that there was a proud horse, which would not be tamed or
bridled; but <i>Amity</i> sent <i>Prudence</i> and <i>Policy</i>,
which tamed him, and <i>Force</i> and <i>Puissance</i> bridled
him.&nbsp; The horse was the French king, Amity the king of
England, and the emperor and other persons were their counsel and
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>When regular plays became established, these motley
exhibitions lost their charm for all, save the vulgar; the law
set its face against them, performers were stigmatised as rogues
and vagabonds, and it is highly probable that necessity suggested
to the <i>tragitour</i> or juggler, who was reduced to one
solitary companion, the jester or jackpudding, to make up his
&ldquo;company,&rdquo; the idea of substituting puppets to supply
the place of other living characters.&nbsp; The drama was in much
the same state of progress throughout the civilized portions of
Europe; and to the Italians and Spaniards the ingenuity of
&ldquo;Punchinello&rdquo; has been attributed.&nbsp; In England
these wooden performers were called <i>motions</i>; and Mr. Punch
took among them the rank of <i>mirth-maker</i>.&nbsp; If there
yet lives a being who has not at some moment of his life felt a
thrill of delight at the prospect of a half-hour&rsquo;s
exhibition of this gentleman&rsquo;s performance in his miniature
theatre, we pity him most heartily.</p>
<p>The oratorio is a mystery or morality in music.&nbsp; The
Oratorio commenced with the priests of the Oratory, a brotherhood
founded at Rome, 1540, by St. Philip Neri, who, in order to
attract the youthful and pleasure-loving to church, had hymns,
psalms, or spiritual songs, or cantatas sung either in chorus or
by a single favourite voice.&nbsp; These pieces were divided into
two parts, one sung before the other, after the sermon.&nbsp;
Sacred stories or events from <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Scripture,
written in verse, and, by way of dialogue, were set to music, and
the first part being performed, the sermon succeeded, which
people were inclined to remain to hear, that they might also hear
the conclusion of the musical performance.&nbsp; This ingenious
device precluded the necessity, we presume, of locking the doors
to prevent the egress of the congregation after prayers, and
before the sermon, that has in some places since been resorted
to.</p>
<p>The institutions of the Oratory required that corporal
punishments should be mingled with their religious harmony; and
the custom would seem to have been, that at certain seasons, of
frequent occurrence, the brethren went through severe castigation
from their own hands, upon their own bodies, with whips of small
cords, delivered to them by officers appointed for the
purpose.&nbsp; This ceremony was performed in the dark, while a
priest recited the Miserere and De Profundis with several
prayers; after which, in silence and gloom, they were permitted
to resume their attire, and refrain from their
self-inflictions.</p>
<p>Mysteries and moralities ceased altogether about the year 1758
in this country; a comedy by Lupton, bearing that date, being
about the last trace of the old school of dramatic writing.&nbsp;
The same year is memorable in this city for the gorgeous
pageantries that marked the progress of England&rsquo;s famous
queen <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>through its streets, on the occasion
of her visit to this then thriving metropolis of wealth and
commerce; and a sketch of the amusements provided for her
entertainment, and the talents put into requisition to do honour
to her august presence, may not be out of place here, containing,
as they do, perhaps some of the latest specimens of the
allegorical dramatic writing that exist.&nbsp; They bear strong
evidence of the encouragement given to literature by Elizabeth,
which had created the fashion for classical allusion upon every
possible occasion; and her admiration of the compliment so
conveyed, caused the mythology of ancient learning to be
introduced into the various shows and spectacles set forth in her
honour, until almost every pageant became a pantheon.</p>
<p>But now for the royal visit, whose glorious memory has shed a
halo over worsted weaving, and bombazines, and stocking
manufactures, and is now enshrined in the magisterial closet of
the Guildhall where the little silver sceptre then bequeathed to
the honoured city lingers as a memento of the great event.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1578, that her Most Gracious Majesty, by
the grace of God, Queen of England, France, and Ireland, was
pleased to honour the city by her royal presence for the space of
six days and nights, during which period the gaiety and
magnificence of the doings would appear to have surpassed all
previous or subsequent experience.&nbsp; The civic <!-- page
245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>functionaries held preliminary meetings to
&lsquo;determine the order of the procession that should welcome
her Majesty, and to decree what preparations should be made for
the event.&nbsp; Great excitement prevailed throughout the city;
streets were cleaned, dirt heaps removed, boats converted into
state barges, velvets and satins, and gold and silver laces
bought up to an immense extent, and, what we would appreciate
more highly still, a decree was passed, banishing for the time
being from the city streets all candle makers and scoutherers,
who used unodoriferous washes that might offend the olfactory
nerves of royalty.&nbsp; This delicate attention we do esteem
most creditable to the good sense of the august body whose care
it was to provide for the comfort of the fair maiden queen.&nbsp;
Another generous resolution was passed by these same gentlemen,
that none of the attendants that might form the retinue of their
sovereign should be unfeasted, or unbidden to dinner and supper
during the whole period of the six days.&nbsp; A devisor, a sort
of lord of misrule, we presume, was chosen to devote himself
exclusively to the gettings up of pageants for the amusement of
the visitors and public; and to his wit and ingenuity we fancy
her majesty was mainly indebted for the enlivenment of her
visit.</p>
<p>The auspicious day arrived, and a gay procession started forth
to meet the royal party.&nbsp; First came in rank, two by two,
three score comely youths of the <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>school of
bachelors, arrayed in doublets of black satin, black hose, black
taffeta hats with yellow bands, and then, as livery, a mandelin
of purple taffeta, trimmed with silver lace.&nbsp; These were
followed by a figure fancifully attired with armour, and velvet
hat and plume, intended to represent King Gurgunt, the reputed
founder of the castle.&nbsp; This personage was attended by three
henchmen, bearing his helmet, staff, and target, and gaily decked
out in livery of white and green, all richly mounted.&nbsp; Next
followed the noble company of gentlemen and wealthy citizens, in
velvet coats and other costly apparel.&nbsp; Then came the
officers of the city, every one in his place; then the
sword-bearer, with the sword and cap of maintenance, next the
mayor in full scarlet robes, lined and trimmed with fur, the
aldermen in their scarlet gowns, and those of them that had been
mayors in cloaks also; next came those who had been sheriffs, in
violet gowns and satin tippets; and lastly, the notorious
whifflers, poising and throwing up their weapons with dexterity,
just sufficient to impart fear and maintain order without doing
mischief.&nbsp; Thus they proceeded some two miles forward on the
road to meet her majesty, King Gurgunt only excepted, who
remained behind, to welcome her majesty at her first view of his
redoubted castle.&nbsp; Then followed all the shouting and
rejoicing usual on such occasions; and when the royal train
arrived, the exchanging <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>of
compliments in flowers of speech, and more substantial coins of
gold.&nbsp; The mayor presented a vase of silver gilt, containing
one hundred pounds of money, as a tribute of loyalty to his
sovereign liege, upon which her majesty exclaimed to her footman,
&ldquo;Look to it! there is one hundred pounds;&rdquo; and in
return, the city was presented with a mace or sceptre richly
gemmed, so that on this occasion, if history tells us true, her
majesty made some return for value received, as was not always
her custom to do.&nbsp; Then followed the speechifyings; first
the mayor&rsquo;s and its answer, and afterwards King
Gurgunt&rsquo;s that <i>was to have been</i>, but fortunately we
must think for her majesty this forty-two lined specimen of
poetry was deferred, in consequence of an April shower.&nbsp;
Triumphal arches welcomed her to the city walls, and pageants met
her eye at every turn.&nbsp; The first pageant was upon a stage
forty feet long and eight broad, with a wall at the back, upon
which was written divers sentences, viz. &ldquo;The causes of the
Commonwealth are God truly preached;&rdquo; &ldquo;Justice truly
executed;&rdquo; &ldquo;The People obedient;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Idleness expelled;&rdquo; &ldquo;Labour cherished;&rdquo;
&ldquo;and universal Concord preserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the front
below, it was painted with representations of various looms, with
weavers working at them,&mdash;over each the name of the loom,
Worsted, Russels, Darnix, Mochado, Lace, Caffa, Fringe.&nbsp;
Another <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>painting of a matron and several
children, over whom was written, &ldquo;Good nurture changeth
qualities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the stage, at one end, stood six
little girls spinning worsted yarn, at the other end the same
number knitting worsted hose; in the centre stood a little boy,
gaily dressed, who represented the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Commonwealth</span> of the city,&rdquo; who made a
lengthened speech, commencing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most gracious prince, undoubted sovereign
queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our only joy next God and chief defence;<br />
In this small shew our whole estate is seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wealth we have we find proceed from thence;<br
/>
The idle hand hath here no place to feed,<br />
The painsful wight hath still to serve his need;<br />
Again our seat denies our traffick here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea too near divides us from the rest.<br />
So weak we were within this dozen year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As care did quench the courage of the best;<br />
But good advice hath taught these little hands<br />
To rend in twain the force of pining bands.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From combed wool we draw the slender thread,<br />
From thence the looms have dealing with the same,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thence again in order do proceed,<br />
These several works which skilful art doth frame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all to drive dame <i>Need</i> into her cave<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our heads and hands together laboured have.<br />
We bought before the things that now we sell.<br />
These slender imps, their works do pass the waves,<br />
Of every mouth the hands the charges saves,<br />
Thus through thy help, and aid of power divine,<br />
Doth Norwich live, whose hearts and goods are
thine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This device gave her majesty much pleasure.</p>
<p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>Another very magnificent affair, with gates of jasper
and marble, was placed across the market-place, five female
figures on the stage above representing the <i>City</i>,
<i>Deborah</i>, <i>Judith</i>, <i>Hester</i>, and <i>Martia</i>
(a queen); whose chief, the <i>City</i>, was spokeswoman first,
and was succeeded by the others each in turn.&nbsp; All that they
said we dare not tarry to repeat; the City expressed herself in
some hundred lines of poetry, the rest rather more briefly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whom fame resounds with thundering trump;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Flower of Grace, Prince of God&rsquo;s Elect;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mighty Queen, finger of the Lord,&rdquo; and such like
hyperbole, made up the substance of their flattery.&nbsp; We know
the good Queen Bess was somewhat fond of such food, but we think
even her taste must have been somewhat palled with the specimens
offered on this occasion.&nbsp; Others of a similar character
were scattered along her pathway to the cathedral.&nbsp; After
service she retired to her quarters at the palace of the
bishop.&nbsp; On the Monday the deviser planned a scheme by which
her majesty was enticed abroad by the invitation of Mercury, who
was sent in a coach covered with birds and little angels in the
air and clouds, a tower in the middle, decked with gold and
jewels, topped by a plume of feathers, spangled and trimmed most
gorgeously; Mercury himself in blue satin, lined with cloth of
gold, with garments cut and slashed according to the most
approved fashion of the day, a peaked hat, <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>made to
&ldquo;<i>cut the wind</i>,&rdquo; a pair of wings on his head
and his <i>heels</i>; in his hand a golden rod with another pair
of wings.&nbsp; The horses of his coach were painted and
furnished each with wings, and made to &ldquo;drive with speed
that might resemble flying;&rdquo; and in this guise did Mercury
present himself before the window at the palace, and tripping
from his throne, made his most humble obeisance and lengthy
speech, all which most graciously was received by her
majesty.&nbsp; Thus ended this day&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, as her majesty proceeded to Cossey Park, for the
purpose of enjoying a day&rsquo;s hunt, another pageant was got
up by the industrious devisor, the subject of which was, Cupid in
Search of a Home&mdash;not, however, much worth detailing.&nbsp;
Wednesday her majesty dined at Surrey House with Lord Surrey, at
which banquet the French ambassadors are said to have been
present; and a pageant was prepared for the occasion, but the
rooms seem to have been rather too small to admit the company of
performers, so it was of necessity deferred.&nbsp; On her road
home, the master of the grammar-school stayed the procession to
deliver a lengthened speech before the gates of the hospital for
old men, to which the queen graciously replied in flattering
terms, presenting her hand to be kissed.&nbsp; Thursday was
marked by divers pageantries, prepared by order of the Lord
Chamberlain, by the devisor.&nbsp; The morning display, <!-- page
251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>which was to enliven her majesty&rsquo;s riding
excursion, was made up of nymphs playing in water, the space
occupied for the same being a square of sixty feet, with a deep
hole four feet square in some part of it, to answer for a
cave.&nbsp; The ground was covered with canvas, painted like
grass, with running cords through the rings attached to its
sides, which obeyed another small cord in the centre, by which
machinery, with two holes on the ground, the earth was made to
appear to open and shut.&nbsp; In the cave, in the centre, was
music, and the twelve water-nymphs, dressed in white silk with
green sedges, so cunningly stitched on them, that nothing else
could be seen.&nbsp; Each carried in her hand a bundle of
bulrushes, and on her head a garland of ivy and a crop of moss,
from whence streamed their long golden tresses over their
shoulders.&nbsp; Four nymphs were to come forth successively and
salute her majesty with a speech, then all twelve were to issue
forth and dance with timbrels.</p>
<p>The show of <i>Manhood and Desert</i>, designed for the
entertainment at Lord Surrey&rsquo;s, was also placed close
by.&nbsp; <i>Manhood</i>, <i>Favour</i>, <i>Desert</i>, striving
for a boy called <i>Beauty</i>, who, however, was to fall to the
share of <i>Good fortune</i>.&nbsp; A battle should have
followed, between six gentlemen on either side, in which
<i>Fortune</i> was to be victorious; <i>during the combat</i>,
<i>legs and arms of men</i> &ldquo;<i>well and lively
wrought</i>&rdquo;, <i>were to be let </i><!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span><i>fall in
numbers on the ground</i> &ldquo;<i>as bloody as might
be</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Fortune</i> marcheth off a conqueror, and
a song for the death of <i>Manhood</i>, <i>Favour</i>, and
<i>Desert</i>, concluded the programme.&nbsp; But, alas! all this
preparation was rendered of no avail, by reason of a drenching
thunder-shower, which so &ldquo;dashed and washed performers and
spectators, that the pastime was reduced to the display of a
dripping multitude, looking like half-drowned rats; and velvets,
silks, tinsels, and cloth of gold, to no end of an amount, fell a
sacrifice to this caprice of the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening entertainment at the guildhall was more
successful, the casualties of rain and wind having no power
there, to disturb the arrangements got up with so much labour and
cost.&nbsp; After a magnificent banquet in the common council
chamber, above the assize court, a princely masque of gods and
goddesses, richly apparelled, was presented before her
majesty.</p>
<p><i>Mercury</i> entered first, followed by two torch-bearers,
in purple taffeta mandillions, laid with silver lace; then the
musicians, dressed in long vestures of white silk girded about
them, and garlands on their heads; next came <i>Jupiter and
Juno</i>, <i>Mars and Venus</i>, <i>Apollo and Pallas</i>,
<i>Neptune and Diana</i>, and lastly <i>Cupid</i>, between each
couple two torch-bearers.&nbsp; Thus they marched round the
chamber, and Mercury delivered his message to the queen.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>&ldquo;The good-meaning mayor and
all his brethren, with the rest, have not rested from praying to
the gods, to prosper thy coming hither; and the gods themselves,
moved by their unfeigned prayers, are ready in person to bid thee
welcome; and I, Mercury, the god of merchants and merchandise,
and therefore a favourer of the citizens, being thought meetest
am chosen fittest to signify the same.&nbsp; Gods there be, also,
which cannot come, being tied by the time of the year, as Ceres
in harvest, Bacchus in wines, Pomona in orchards.&nbsp; Only
Hymeneus denieth his good-will either in presence or in person;
notwithstanding Diana hast so counter-checked him, therefore, as
he shall hereafter be at your commandment.&nbsp; For my part, as
I am a rejoicer at your coming, so am I furtherer of your welcome
hither, and for this time I bid you farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All then marched about again, at the close of each circuit,
stopping for the gods to present each a gift to her majesty;
Jupiter, a riding wand of whalebone, curiously wrought; Mars, a
<i>fair pair of knives</i>; Venus, a white dove; Apollo, a
musical instrument, called a bandonet; Pallas, a book of
<i>wisdom</i>; Neptune, a fish; Diana, a bow and arrows, of
silver; Cupid, an arrow of gold, with these lines on the
shaft&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My colour <i>joy</i>, my substance
<i>pure</i>,<br />
My <i>virtue</i> such as shall endure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>The queen received the gifts with gracious
condescension, listening the while to the verses recited by the
gods as accompaniments.</p>
<p>On Friday, being the day fixed for her majesty&rsquo;s
departure, the devisor prepared one last grand spectacle, water
spirits, to the sound of whose timbrels was spoken &ldquo;her
majesty&rsquo;s farewell to Norwich;&rdquo; and thus terminated
this season of rejoicing, but not with it the results of the
royal visitation.</p>
<p>The train of gay carriages that had formed the retinue of the
fair queen, were said to have left behind them the infection of
the plague; and scarcely had the last echoes of merriment and joy
faded upon the ear, when the deep thrilling notes of wailing and
lamentation broke forth from crushed hearts.&nbsp; Death held his
reign of terror, threw his black mantle of gloom over the
stricken city, and wrapped its folds around each hearth and home,
and banquet chamber&mdash;sunshine was followed by clouds and
storm, and thunders of wrath&mdash;feast-makers, devisors, and
players&mdash;Gurgunt, Mercury, Cupid, and Apollo, laid down
their trappings, and in their stricken houses died alone.&nbsp;
The finger-writing upon the door-posts marked each smitten home
with the touching prayer, &ldquo;The Lord have mercy upon
us!&rdquo;&nbsp; The insignia of the white wand borne by the
infected ones, who issued forth into the streets from their
tainted atmospheres, warned off communion with their fellow men,
and <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>sorrow filled all hearts;&mdash;a
year of sadness and gloom followed&mdash;men&rsquo;s hearts
failing them for fear.&nbsp; Scarcely had the plague lifted its
hand from oppressing the people, ere the benumbed faculties of
the woe-begone mourners were roused to fresh terror, by the
grumbling murmurs of an earthquake;&mdash;storms, lightnings,
hailstones, and tempests spread desolation in their course
through all parts of the country in quick succession&mdash;a very
age of trouble.</p>
<p>But turning from dark scenes of history once more to the
sports and pastimes that gladdened the hearts and eyes of the
good old citizens of yore, we must not fail to chronicle the
famous visit of Will Kempe, the morris dancer, whose &ldquo;nine
days&rsquo; wonder,&rdquo; or dance from London to Norwich in
nine days, has been recorded by himself in a merry little
pamphlet bearing internal evidence of a lightness of heart
rivalling the lightness of toe that gained for him his
Terpsichorean fame.&nbsp; His name receives a fresh halo of
interest from its association with that of one of the great ones
of the earth, Will Shakespeare, in whose company of players at
the Globe, Blackfriars, he was a comedian; and his signature and
that of the dramatist&rsquo;s stand together at the foot of a
counter petition presented at the same time with one got up by
the inhabitants of the neighbourhood against the continuance of
plays in that house.&nbsp; Kempe played Peter and Dogberry in
&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; and <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>&ldquo;Much
Ado about Nothing;&rdquo; also, Launce, Touchstone, Gravedigger,
Justice Shallow, and Launcelot.&nbsp; One feels that the morris
dancer has a fresh claim upon our interest by such associations,
and we look into the merry book dedicated to Mistress Anne
Fitton, maid of honour to England&rsquo;s maiden queen, prepared
to relish heartily the frolicsome account of how he tript it
merrily to the music of Thomas Slye, his taberer, gaining every
where the admiration of the wondering townsfolk and villagers
upon his road, receiving, and occasionally of necessity refusing,
their profusely proffered hospitalities, and now and then
accepting their offers to tread a measure with him at his pace, a
feat that one brave and buxom lass alone was found equal to
perform&mdash;one can appreciate the quiet fun in which he
permits himself to indulge at the discomfiture of the followers
who track his flying steps, when their running accompaniment is
interrupted by the mud and mire of the unmacadamized
medi&aelig;val substitutes for turnpike roads, where occasionally
he dances on, leaving the volunteer corps up to their necks in
some slough of despond.&nbsp; Such a picture of the highways in
the good old times, is consolatory to the unfortunate generation
of the nineteenth century, who, among their many burdens and
oppressions, can at least congratulate themselves that in respect
to locomotion, the lines have fallen to them in pleasanter
places.</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>The morris dance in its original glory was most
frequently joined to processions and pageants, especially to
those appropriated to the celebration of the May games.&nbsp; The
chief dancer was more superbly dressed than his comrades, and on
these occasions was presumed to personate Robin Hood; the maid
Marian, and others supposed to have been the outlaw&rsquo;s
companions, were the characters supported by the rest; and the
hobby-horse, or a dragon, sometimes both, made a part of the
display.</p>
<p>It was by some supposed to have been imported from the Moors,
and was probably a kind of Pyrrhic or military dance, usually
performed with staves and bells attached to the feet, each of
which had its several tone and name; the men who danced it, when
in full character, were accompanied by a boy dressed as a girl,
and styled the maid <i>Marion</i> (or Morian, possibly from the
Italian Moriane, a head piece, because his head was generally
gaily decked out).</p>
<p>The hobby-horse was originally a necessary accompaniment of
the morris dance, but the Puritans had banished it before the
time of the hero Kempe,&mdash;why, or wherefore, it is difficult
to imagine, as his presence, with a ladle attached to his mouth
to collect the douceurs of the spectators, must have been as
harmless, one would fancy, as that of the <i>fool</i> who
succeeded him in the office.</p>
<p><!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>In Edward the Fourth&rsquo;s reign, we find mention
made of <i>hoblers</i>, or persons who were obliged by tenure to
send a light swift horse to carry tidings of invasion from the
sea-side&mdash;light horsemen from this came to be called
hoblers&mdash;and doubtless from this origin sprang the term
hobby-horse&mdash;hence the allusion to men riding their
hobby.</p>
<p>Kempe&rsquo;s dance is alluded to by Ben Jonson, in his
&ldquo;Every Man out of his Humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his own
narrative he alludes to some other similar exploit he had it in
his mind to perform; but as no record exists of its
accomplishment, we are left to infer that the entrance made of
the death of one Will Kempe, at the time of the plague, November
1603, in the parish books of one of the metropolitan churches,
refers to the merry comedian, and that his career was suddenly
terminated by that unsightly foe.</p>
<p>In 1609, a tract with an account of a morris dance performed
by twelve individuals who had attained the age of a hundred, was
published, &ldquo;to which,&rdquo; it was added,
&ldquo;Kempe&rsquo;s morris dance was no more than a galliord on
a common stage at the end of an old dead comedy, is to a caranto
danced on the ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long subsequent to these events, theatres became settled
down into stationary objects of attraction and amusement; and in
most large cities, companies were formed to conduct the business
of the performances.&nbsp; Among the epitaphs in the principal
churchyard <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span

<p>The subject of Pageantry may not be fitly closed without
notice of the costly displays of magnificence that characterize
the various processions and ceremonies that have become classed
under the same title, although distinct altogether from the
original dramatic representations to which the name
belonged.&nbsp; <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>Some of these, in honour of saints
and martyrs, long since dead even to the memory of enlightened
Protestantism, partake more of the character of religious
festivals than any thing else; and among them the annual
commemoration of St. Nicholas day, by the election of the Boy
Bishop, peculiarly deserves to be classed.&nbsp; In olden times,
on the 6th of December, it was an invariable custom for the boys
of every cathedral choir to make choice of one of their number to
maintain the state and authority of a bishop, from that time
until the 28th, or Innocent&rsquo;s day, during which period he
was habited in rich episcopal robes, wore a mitre on his head,
and carried a crosier in his hand; his companions assumed the
dress and character of priests, yielding to their head all
canonical obedience, and between them performing all the services
of the church excepting mass.&nbsp; On the eve of
Innocent&rsquo;s day, the Boy Bishop, and his youthful clergy in
their caps, and with lighted tapers in their hand, went in solemn
procession, chaunting and singing versicles, as they walked into
the choir by the west door; the dean and canons of the Cathedral
went first, the chaplains followed, and the Boy Bishop with his
priests in the last and highest place.&nbsp; The Boy Bishop then
took his seat, and the rest of the juveniles dispersed themselves
on each side the choir on the uppermost ascent.&nbsp; The
resident canons bearing the incense and book, the <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>minor canons the tapers, he afterwards proceeded to the
altar of the Trinity, which he censed, and then the image of the
Trinity, his priests all the while singing.&nbsp; They all then
joined in chaunting a service with prayers and responses, and in
conclusion the Boy Bishop gave his benediction to the
people.&nbsp; After he received the crosier, other ceremonies
were performed, and he chaunted the complyn, and turning towards
the choir delivered an exhortation.&nbsp; If any prebends fell
vacant during his episcopal power, he had the power of disposing
of them; and if he died during the month he was buried in his
robes, his funeral was celebrated with great pomp, and a monument
was erected to his memory with his effigy.</p>
<p>The discovery of a monument of this character, some hundred
and seventy years since, in Salisbury Cathedral, caused much
amazement to the many then unread in antiquarian lore, who
marvelled much at the anomalous affair, wondering however a
bishop could have been so small, or a child so rich in
ecclesiastical garments.</p>
<p>From this custom originated the but lately discontinued
honours, annually awarded to the head boy in most grammar
schools, who had a place in grand civic processions, and for a
season at least was magnified into a great personage.</p>
<p>The origin of this festival, on St Nicholas day, is involved
like most others in much obscurity, and <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>buried in
heaps of legendary mysticism.&nbsp; The tale upon which it is
said to have been founded is, that in the fourth century St.
Nicholas was bishop of Myra, when two young gentlemen arrived at
that city on their road to Athens, whither they were going to
complete their education.&nbsp; By their father&rsquo;s desire
they were to seek the benediction of the bishop on their way, but
as it was late at night when they reached Myra, they deferred
doing so till the next morning; but in the meantime the host of
the inn at which they were lodging, stimulated by avarice to
possess himself of their property, killed the young gentlemen,
cut them in pieces, salted them, and purposed to sell them for
pickled pork.</p>
<p>St. Nicholas, the bishop, being favoured with a sight of these
proceedings in a vision, (or, as we should now-a-days express it,
by <i>clairvoyance</i>) went to the inn, reproached the cruel
landlord for his crime, who, confessing it, entreated the saint
to pray to heaven for his pardon.&nbsp; The bishop, moved by his
entreaties, besought pardon for him, and restoration of life to
the children.&nbsp; He had scarcely finished, when the pickled
pieces re-united, and the animated youths threw themselves from
the brine-tub at the bishop&rsquo;s feet; he raised them up,
exhorted them to ascribe the praise to God alone, and sent them
forward on their journey, with much good counsel.</p>
<p>Such is the miracle handed down as the cause of <!-- page
263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>the adoption of Saint Nicholas as the patron saint of
children.&nbsp; The Eton Montem is considered to be a corruption
of the ceremony of electing a boy-bishop, probably changed at the
time of the suppression of the religious festivals at the
Reformation.</p>
<p>One other pageant, more especially connected with the history
of a manufacturing city, is the procession of Bishop Blaize, or
St. Blazius, the great patron saint of wool-combers; in which
usually figured Jason, the hero of the &ldquo;golden
fleece,&rdquo; and forty Argonauts on horseback, the emblems of
the expedition, preceded by Hercules, Peace, Plenty, and
Britannia.&nbsp; These were followed by the bishop, dressed in
episcopal costume, crowned with a mitre of wool, drawn in an open
chariot by six horses, and attended by vergers, bands of music,
the city standard, a chaplain, and orators delivering, at
intervals, grandiloquent speeches.&nbsp; Seven companies of
wool-combers on foot, and five on horseback, brought up the rear;
shepherds, shepherdesses, tastefully attired in fancy costumes,
added to the brilliancy of the display.&nbsp; Bishop Blazius, the
principal personage in the festivity, was Bishop of Sebesta, in
Armenia, and the reputed inventor of the art of combing
wool.&nbsp; The Romish church canonized the saint, and attributed
to his miraculous interposition many wondrous miracles.&nbsp;
Divers charms, also, for extracting thorns from the body, or a
bone from the throat, were prescribed to be uttered in his
name.</p>
<p><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>Among the festivals that lay claim to antiquity, of
which some faint traces, at least, are left in the observances of
the nineteenth century, are some few that belong as much to the
history of the present as the past, and must not be omitted in
sketches of the characteristic features of an old city.&nbsp; The
Fair&mdash;the great annual gatherings of wooden houses and
wooden horses, tin trumpets, and spice nuts, Diss bread, and
gingerbread&mdash;menageries of wild natural history, and
caravans of tame <i>unnatural</i> collections, giants, dwarfs,
albinos, and <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i> of every conceivable
deformity&mdash;of things above the earth and under the earth, in
the sea and out of the sea&mdash;of panoramas,
dioramas&mdash;wax-works, with severable heads and moving
countenances&mdash;of Egyptian tents, with glass factories in
miniature concealed within their mystic folds, under the guidance
of the glass-wigged alchemist, the presiding
genius&mdash;performing canaries, doing the Mr. and Mrs. Caudle,
and firing off pistols&mdash;pert hares playing on the
tambourine, and targets and guns to be played with for prizes of
nuts, and whirligigs and rocking-boats&mdash;the avenues of
sailcloth, with their linings of confectionary, toys,
basket-work, and ornamental stationery&mdash;the gong and the
drum, and the torrents of Cheap-Jack eloquence, mingling with the
music of the leopard-clad minstrels of the zoological
departments;&mdash;dear is the holiday to the hearts, and
memories, and anticipations, of <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>many an
<i>enlightened</i> infant of this highly developed age;&mdash;as
dear, and welcome, and thrilling, in its confusion of noise, and
bewilderment of colour, as ever of old, to the children of larger
growth, who, in the infancy of civilization, were wont to find in
them their primers of learning, arts, and sciences.</p>
<p>When trade was principally carried on by means of fairs, and
they lasted many days, the merchants who frequented them for
business purposes, used every art and means to draw people
together, and were therefore accompanied, we are told, by
jugglers, minstrels, and buffoons; and as then few public
amusements or spectacles were established, either in cities or
towns, the fair-time was almost the only season of
diversion.&nbsp; The clergy, finding that the entertainments of
dancing, music, mimicry, &amp;c. exhibited at them, drew people
from their religious duties, in the days of their power
proscribed them&mdash;but to no purpose; and failing in their
efforts, with the ingenuity that characterized their age and
profession, changed their tastes, and took the recreations into
their own hands, turned actors and play-writers themselves, and
substituted the Religious Mysteries for the profane punchinellos
and juggleries that have since, in later times, resumed their
sway, undisputed by any ecclesiastical rivals for popular
applause in the dramatic line.</p>
<p>Among other sports that formed the attractions to <!-- page
266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>the Fair in olden times, was the Quintain, a game of
contest, memorable in the annals of the city, as having on one
occasion, in the reign of Edward I., been made the opportunity of
commencing hostilities of a far more formidable nature and
protracted extent than the occasion itself could warrant, or be
presumed to cause.</p>
<p>The Quintain was a post fixed strongly in the ground, with a
piece of wood, about six feet long, laid across it on the top,
placed so as to turn round; on one end of this cross-piece was
hung a bag, containing a hundred-weight of sand, which was called
the <i>Quintal</i>; at the other end was fixed a board about a
foot square, at which the player, who was mounted on horseback,
with a truncheon, pole, or sort of tilting-spear, ran direct with
force; if he was skilful, the board gave way, and he passed on
before the bag reached him, in which feat lay success; but if he
hit the board, but was not expert enough to escape, the bag swung
round, and striking him, often dismounted him; to miss the board
altogether was, however, the greatest disgrace.&nbsp; The quarrel
alluded to, arose ostensibly about the truncheons, but it was
supposed really to have been at the instigation of other persons,
both on the part of the monastery and city.</p>
<p>Tombland Fair stands not quite alone as a memorial of ancient
festivals held in honour of patron saints&mdash;one other day in
the year stands forth in the <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>calendar of
juvenile and mature enjoyments, unrivalled in its claim upon our
notice and our love.&nbsp; St. Valentine, that &ldquo;man of most
admirable parts, so famous for his love and charity that the
custom of choosing valentines upon his festival took its rise
from thence,&rdquo; as Wheatley tells us,&mdash;is yet, even to
this hour, held in high honour, and most gloriously commemorated
in this good old city, and in so unique a fashion, that a few
words may not suffice to give a true delineation of it.&nbsp; The
approach of the happy day is heralded, in these days of
steam-presses and local journals, by monster-typed
advertisements, gigantically headed
&ldquo;<i>Valentines</i>,&rdquo; or huge labels, bearing the same
mystic letters, carefully arranged in the midst of
gorgeously-decked windows, towards which young eyes turn in
glistening hope and admiration; and at sight of which little
hearts beat high with eager expectation.&nbsp; Not of Cupids, and
hearts, and darts, and such like merry conceits on fairy-mottoed
note paper, doth the offerings of St. Valentine consist in this
good old mart of commerce;&mdash;far more real and substantial
are the samples of taste, ornament, and use, that rank themselves
in the category of his gifts.&nbsp; The jeweller&rsquo;s front,
radiant with gold and precious gems, and frosted silver, and
ruby-eyed oxydized owls, Russian malachite fashioned into every
conceivable fantasy of invention, brooches, bracelets, crosses,
studs masculine and feminine, chatelaines <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>ditto, and
not a few of <i>epicene</i> characteristics, betokening the signs
of the times,&mdash;all claim to rank under the title.&nbsp; The
Drapers&mdash;especially the &ldquo;French depots,&rdquo; with
their large assortments on shew, in remote <i>bazaars</i>
appropriated exclusively to the business of the festive season,
where labyrinths of dressing-cases, desks, work-boxes, inkstands,
and <i>portfeuilles</i>, usurp the place of lawful mercery, and
haberdashery for the time being yields place to stationery,
perfumery, <i>bijouterie</i>, and cutlery, proclaim the triumphs
of his reign in their midst.&nbsp; But supreme above all, are the
glories that the toy-shops display, from the gay balcony-fronted
repository for all the choicest inventions science, skill, or wit
can devise, at once to please the fancy, help the brain, tax the
ingenuity of childhood, or dazzle the eye of babyhood, downwards
through the less <i>recherch&eacute;</i>, but scarcely less
thronged marts, a grade below in price and quality, to the very
huckster&rsquo;s stall or apple booth, that shall for the time
being add its quota of penny whips, tin trumpets, and
long-legged, brittle-jointed, high-combed Dutch ladies, whose
proportions exhibit any thing but the contour usually described
as a &ldquo;Dutch build.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor these alone&mdash;the
shoemaker&rsquo;s, with its newly-acquired treasures of gutta
percha knick-knacks, flower-pots, card-trays, inkstands,
picture-frames, boxes, caddies, medallions, and what-not that is
useful and ornamental, in addition to shoe-soles <!-- page

269</span>with a propensity to adhere to hot iron, and betray by
deeply indented gutters the impress of any new bright-topped
fender on which they have chanced to trespass&mdash;all, all, are
offerings at the shrine of good St. Valentine; how, when, and
where, we have yet to see.</p>
<p>One peep behind these plate-glassed drop scenes&mdash;one
visit to the toy-shop&mdash;it is an event&mdash;a circumstance
to be chronicled&mdash;even the quiet, mild, and self-possessed
proprietress of all the wealth of fun and fashion, use and
ornament, and zoology, from the rocking-horse down to the Chinese
spider, and Noah&rsquo;s ark to lady-birds, for once looks heated
and tired; and one feels impelled to cheer the kind-hearted,
gentle matron, by reminding her, that her toil will be repaid
tenfold, by pleasant thoughts of the myriad shouts of welcome and
heartfelt glee that, ere long, will have been hymned forth in
praise of the perfection of her taste.</p>
<p>Her labours and toils would seem scarcely to surpass those of
her purchasers.&nbsp; The perplexity and labyrinth of doubt and
difficulty they find themselves in is truly pitiable; the annual
return of a festival when every body, from grandpapa and
grandmamma to baby bo, is expected to receive and give some
offering commemorative of the season, causes, in time, a
considerable difficulty in the choice of gifts, and added to the
mystifications of memory as to who has <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>what? and
what hasn&rsquo;t who? produces a perfect bewilderment.&nbsp; The
fluctuations between dominoes, bats and traps, dolls, la
gr&agrave;ce, draughts, chess, rocks of Scilly, German tactics,
fox and geese, printing machines, panoramas, puzzles, farmy-ards,
battledores, doll&rsquo;s houses, compasses, knitting cases, and
a myriad others, seem interminable&mdash;but an end must come,
and the purchaser and seller find rest.</p>
<p>But all this toil is but the prelude to the grand act of the
drama; Valentine&rsquo;s eve arrived, the play begins in
earnest.&nbsp; The streets swarm with carriers, and baskets laden
with treasures&mdash;bang, bang, bang go the knockers, and away
rushes the banger, depositing first upon the door-step some
package from the basket of stores&mdash;again and again at
intervals, at every door to which a missive is addressed, is the
same repeated till the baskets are empty.&nbsp; Anonymously St.
Valentine presents his gifts, labelled only with &ldquo;St.
Valentine&rsquo;s&rdquo; love, and &ldquo;Good morrow,
Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then within the houses of destination&mdash;the screams, the
shouts, the rushings to catch the bang bangs&mdash;the flushed
faces, sparkling eyes, rushing feet to pick up the fairy
gifts&mdash;inscriptions to be interpreted, mysteries to be
unravelled, hoaxes to be found out&mdash;great hampers, heavy,
and ticketed &ldquo;With care, this side upwards,&rdquo; to be
unpacked, out of which jump live little boys with St.
Valentine&rsquo;s love to the little ladies fair&mdash;<!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>the sham bang bangs, that bring nothing but noise and
fun&mdash;the mock parcels that vanish from the door step by
invisible strings when the door opens&mdash;monster parcels that
dwindle to thread-papers denuded of their multiplied envelopes,
with pithy mottoes, all tending to the final consummation of good
counsel, &ldquo;Happy is he who expects nothing, and he will not
be disappointed!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a glorious night, marvel not
that we would perpetuate so joyous a festivity.&nbsp; We love its
mirth, the memory of its smiles and mysteries of loving kindness,
its tender reverential tributes to old age, and time-tried
friendship, amid the throng of sprightlier festal offerings, that
mark the season in our hearths and homes, as sacred to a love so
pure, so true, and holy, that good St. Valentine himself may feel
justly proud of such commemoration.</p>
<p>How and when this peculiar mode of celebrating the festival
arose it would be difficult perhaps to discover.&nbsp; In olden
times, as we find by the diary of Dr. Browne, the more prevalent
custom of drawing valentines on the eve before Valentine day was
in vogue; but Forby&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vocabulary of East
Anglia&rdquo; makes mention of a practice which doubtless has
become developed in the course of time into the elaborate and
costly celebration of the present day.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;In
Norfolk it is the custom for children to &lsquo;catch&rsquo; each
other for valentines; and if there are elderly persons in the
family who are likely to be liberal, <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>great care
is taken to catch them.&nbsp; The mode of catching is by saying
&lsquo;Good morrow, Valentine,&rsquo; and if they can repeat this
before they are spoken to, they are rewarded with a small
present.&nbsp; It must be done, however, before sunrise;
otherwise instead of a reward, they are told they are
<i>sunburnt</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds a query&mdash;Does this
illustrate the phrase <i>sunburned</i>, in &ldquo;Much Ado about
Nothing&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The universal respect in which the anniversary of St.
Valentine is held, may perhaps be most justly estimated by the
statistical facts that relate to the post-office transactions for
that day, in comparison with the average amount of the daily
transmissions; and each district has probably some peculiar mode
of celebrating it,&mdash;but nowhere, we imagine, does its annual
return leave behind it such pleasing and substantial memorials as
in our &ldquo;Old City.&rdquo;&nbsp; Douce, in his
&ldquo;Illustrations of Shakespeare,&rdquo; would have us believe
that the observances of St. Valentine&rsquo;s day had their
origin in the festivals of ancient Rome during the month of
February, when they celebrated the &ldquo;Lupercalia,&rdquo; or
feasts in honour of Pan and Juno, sometimes called Februalis, on
which occasion, amidst a variety of other ceremonies, the names
of young men and maidens were put into a box, and drawn as chance
directed.&nbsp; The pastors of the early church, in their
endeavours to eradicate the vestiges of popular superstitions,
substituted the names of <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span><i>saints</i> for those of the young maidens, and as
the Lupercalia commenced in February, affixed the observance to
the feast of St. Valentine in that month, thus preserving the
outline of the ancient ceremony, to which the people were
attached, modified by an adaptation to the Christian system.</p>
<p>Time, however, would seem to have restored the maidens to
their original position.&nbsp; Brande has given many curious
details of the various modes of celebrating the anniversary, in
addition to the universal interchange of illuminated letters and
notes.&nbsp; In Oxfordshire the children go about collecting
pence, singing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Good morrow, Valentine,<br />
First &rsquo;tis yours, then &rsquo;tis mine,<br />
So please give me a Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some other counties the poorer classes of children dress
themselves fantastically, and visit the houses of the great,
singing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, Valentine,<br />
Curl your locks as I do mine,<br />
Two before and three behind&mdash;<br />
Good morrow to you, Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other parts the first member of the opposite sex that is
seen by any individual is said to be his or her
&ldquo;Valentine.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the case in Berkshire and
some other of the neighbouring counties.&nbsp; Pepys, in his
&ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;St. Valentine&rsquo;s day,
1667.&nbsp; This morning <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>came up to
my wife&rsquo;s bedside, I being up dressing myself, little Will
Mercer, to be her Valentine, and brought her name written upon
blue paper in gold letters done by himself very pretty; and we
were both well pleased with it.&nbsp; But I am also this year my
wife&rsquo;s Valentine, which will cost me &pound;5&mdash;but
that I must have laid out if we had not been
Valentines.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterwards adds, &ldquo;I find that
Mrs. Pierce&rsquo;s little girl is my Valentine, she having drawn
me, which I was not sorry for, it easing me of something more I
must have given to others.&nbsp; But here I do first observe the
fashion of drawing of mottoes as well as names; so that Pierce
who drew my wife, did also draw a mottoe, and this girl drew
another for me.&nbsp; What mine was I forget; but my wife&rsquo;s
was, &lsquo;Most courteous and most fair.&rsquo;&nbsp; One wonder
I observed to-day, that there was no music in the morning to call
up our new-married people, which is very mean
methinks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The custom of presenting gifts seems then
to have been practised.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;British Apollo,&rdquo; 1708, a sort of
&ldquo;Notes and Queries&rdquo; of the day, we read,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why Valentine&rsquo;s a day to choose<br />
A mistress, and our freedom lose?<br />
May I my reason interpose,<br />
The question with an answer close;<br />
To imitate we have a mind,<br />
And couple like the winged kind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same work, &ldquo;1709, Query.&mdash;In choosing <!--
page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>Valentines (according to custom), is not the party
choosing (be it man or woman) to make a present to the party
chosen?&nbsp; Answer.&mdash;We think it more proper to say
drawing of Valentines, since the most customary way is for each
to take his or her lot, and chance cannot be termed choice.&nbsp;
According to this method the obligations are equal, and,
therefore, it was formerly the custom mutually to present, but
now it is customary only for the gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Scotland presents are reciprocally made on the day.</p>
<p>Gay has given a poetical description of some rural ceremonies
used in the morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Last Valentine, the day when birds of
kind<br />
Their paramours with mutual chirpings find,<br />
I early rose, just at the break of day,<br />
Before the sun had chased the stars away;<br />
A-field I went amid the morning dew,<br />
To milk my kine (for so should house-wives do).<br />
The first I spied, and the first swain we see,<br />
In spite of Fortune shall our true love be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following curious practice on Valentine&rsquo;s day or eve
is mentioned in the &ldquo;Connoisseur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Last
Friday was Valentine&rsquo;s day, and the night before I got five
bay leaves, and pinned four of them to the corners of my pillow,
and the fifth in the middle; and then if I dreamt of my
sweetheart, Betty said we should be married before the year was
out.&nbsp; But to make it more sure, I boiled an egg hard, and
took out the yolk and filled it with salt; and when I <!-- page
276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>went to bed, eat it shell and all, without speaking or
drinking after it.&nbsp; We also wrote the names of our lovers
upon bits of paper, and rolled them up in clay and put them into
water, and the first that rose up was to be our
Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The popular tradition, that the birds select mates on this
day, is the last subject to be mentioned.&nbsp; Shakespeare
alludes to it in the &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;St.
Valentine is past;<br />
Begin these wood birds but to couple now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fable,&rdquo; who cannot call to mind?
and its moral may close our notice of St. Valentine&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Misses, the tale that I relate,<br />
This lesson seems to carry&mdash;<br />
Choose not alone a proper mate,<br />
But proper time to marry?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list of pageantries and festivals must now close, with an
attempt to chronicle the glories of a modern &ldquo;chairing
day;&rdquo; and the more imperative does it seem to find a place
in history for this last stray sunbeam of medi&aelig;val
splendour, that it bids fair, amidst the growth of sobriety in
this utilitarian age, to share all, too soon, the fate of its
ancestors, who found their grave in the first
&ldquo;dissolution&rdquo; and after-flood of Puritanism.&nbsp;
There may be who would liken this relic of pageantry to a
lingering mote of feudalism, that the penetrating broom of reform
had <!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>done well to sweep from the pathway
of a &ldquo;free and enlightened people;&rdquo; who would hint
that the old custom is more honoured in the breach than the
observance; and towards their opinion seems to incline that of
the chief performers in the modern
&ldquo;<i>mystery</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the M.P. himself, whose
nerves, proprieties, and objections have unitedly rebelled
against submission to these antiquated practices of this
antiquated place.&nbsp; It is therefore scarcely what <i>is</i>,
but what <i>has been</i>, that we have to commemorate in our
detail.</p>
<p>When the onerous duty of selecting a representative of the
people&rsquo;s voice, wishes, and will in the councils of the
nation has been completed by the calm, deliberate, dispassionate,
and disinterested decision of the enfranchised tithe of the
city&rsquo;s populace, the successful candidates are, or
<i>were</i>, wont to receive installation from the hands of their
constituents by a &ldquo;toss up,&rdquo; not, we would inform our
countrymen of the &ldquo;<i>sheeres</i>,&rdquo; (meaning all
other counties save Norfolk, Suffolk, and Kent)&mdash;not that
they engage in any little gambling speculation, such as is
usually known under a similar name, but that they are required to
submit to be made shuttlecocks for some few hours, for the
amusement of the admiring multitude; and seeing that the fun and
frolic thus afforded is, or <i>was</i>, the sole share of
nine-tenths of the population in the transaction of electing the
&ldquo;unruly member&rdquo; that is to speak the hopes, wants,
<!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>dissatisfactions, and grumblings of a large city, it
may seem somewhat hard to them that they should be deprived of
it.&nbsp; The order of carrying out this provincial mode of
installation, consists in forming a grand procession, as it is
called, made up of as many carriages and horsemen as the stables
of the city and neighbourhood, private and public, may contrive
to turn out, the <i>colour</i> and popularity of the candidate of
course exercising its influence upon <i>quantity</i> and
<i>quality</i>.&nbsp; The days of velvet doublets and liveries of
silver and gold being passed, the candidate makes no pretensions
to display in the toilettes of the gentlemen&mdash;plain, sober
black predominates throughout the mass; no shadow of a variation,
save and except in the &ldquo;dramatis person&aelig;,&rdquo; who
take their stand upon the battledores provided for them, arrayed
in full court costume or regimentals, as the case may be.&nbsp;
To particularize more closely, it should be stated, that the
battledores, as we have chosen to designate them, are wooden
platforms, borne upon the shoulders of some two or three dozen
men; the platform supports a chair elaborately ornamented, blue
and silver, or purple and orange, as the successful candidates
may be <i>blues</i> or <i>purples</i>&mdash;Whigs or
Tories.&nbsp; Besides the chair, the platform supports the
fortunate M.P. himself, standing, aided in balancing himself in
the elevated pinnacle of glory to which he has attained, by the
back or elbows of the <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>chair, which piece of luxury, we
presume, must be intended solely as a symbol of the easy berth in
prospect, since throughout the long sunny scorching
perambulations of city streets and market-place, it may seldom,
if ever, be ventured to be indulged in as a resting place.&nbsp;
Meantime, every window, balcony, house-top, church-tower, and
parapet-wall, has been lined with anxious and eager
lookers-on&mdash;every space and avenue leading to or adjoining
the line of march has been thronged; flags, banners, &amp;c.
&amp;c., have been marshalled into the procession, whose pathway
is cleared and protected by a locomotive body-guard of <i>posse
men</i>, bearing horizontally in their hands long poles, which
are presumed to act as barriers to the encroachments of the
multitude without the pale.&nbsp; The line of procession once
formed, in due order they make their triumphal progress, bowing,
smiling, and trembling on their elevations, as they draw near to
the thronging frontage of any loyal constituent, whose colours
are a signal for the game to commence.&nbsp; Up, then, goes the
M.P. high in the air,&mdash;once, twice, thrice, again and again,
fortunate and clever if he comes down perpendicularly.&nbsp;
Perfection and elegance in the peculiar <i>pas de seal</i>
requires much practice and many experiments; but as the
<i>move</i> is repeated very frequently, at very short intervals,
during the progress round the city, possibly one experience may
suffice in a <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>life-time.&nbsp; The exhibition is
occasionally closed by the bearers of the two candidates making a
match with each other as to who can toss longest and highest,
which done, the victimized shuttlecocks and the delighted
spectators are permitted to retire.&nbsp; The origin of this very
singular act of homage is not very clear; but as one or two
recent outbursts of popular enthusiasm have manifested themselves
in a similar form&mdash;to wit, laying violent hands upon a
popular favourite and tossing him in the air, with neither
platform or chair to lend grace to the proceeding&mdash;we must
suppose that some traditionary virtue is attached to the act; and
this supposition is somewhat confirmed by the fact that a
superstitious practice of &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; or
&ldquo;heaving,&rdquo; very similar in its mode of operation, is
still observed on Easter Monday and Tuesday in some other English
counties.&nbsp; The men and women on these days alternately
exercise the privilege of seizing and &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; any
member of the opposite sex that they may chance to meet, and
claim a fee for the honour.&nbsp; In the records of the Tower of
London, may be found a document purporting to set forth how such
payment was made to certain ladies and maids of honour for
&ldquo;taking&rdquo; (or &ldquo;lifting&rdquo;) King Edward I. at
Easter, a custom then prevalent throughout the kingdom.&nbsp;
Brande gives an amusing account of an occurrence in Shrewsbury,
extracted from a letter from Mr. <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Thomas
Loggan, of Basinghall Street.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I was sitting
alone last Easter Tuesday at breakfast, at the Talbot, in
Shrewsbury, when I was surprised by the entrance of all the
female servants of the house handing in an arm-chair, lined with
white, and decorated with ribbons and favours of all kinds.&nbsp;
I asked them what they wanted; they said they came to
&lsquo;heave&rsquo; me; it was the custom of their place, and
they hoped I would take a seat in the chair.&nbsp; It was
impossible not to comply with a request so modestly made by a set
of nymphs in their best apparel, and several of them under
twenty.&nbsp; I wished to see all the ceremony, and seated myself
accordingly; the group then lifted me from the ground, turned the
chair about, and I had the felicity of a salute from each.&nbsp;
I told them I supposed there was a fee due, and was answered in
the affirmative; and having satisfied the damsels in this
respect, they retired to &lsquo;heave&rsquo; others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usage is said to be a vulgar commemoration of the event
which the festival of Easter celebrates.&nbsp; Lancashire,
Staffordshire, and Warwickshire still retain the Easter
custom.</p>
<p>Whether or not the notable Norfolk &ldquo;chairing&rdquo;
takes its origin from the same is open to question;
<i>possibility</i> there is without doubt that it does so.&nbsp;
Be it as it may, it must, we fear, be numbered among the departed
joys of the poor folks.</p>

Mrs. Lubbock</i>.&mdash;<i>Prophecies</i>.&mdash;<i>Treasure

on the Great and Noble in Early Times</i>.</p>
<p>Forby, in his &ldquo;Vocabulary of East Anglia,&rdquo; has
described the whole of this district of the country as barren of
superstitions or legendary lore.&nbsp; Its characteristics are
adverse to the growth of that natural poetry in the minds of the
people which gives birth to nymphs, water-sprites, elves, or
demons.&nbsp; It has neither woods, mountains, rocks, caverns,
nor waterfalls, to be the nurseries of such genii; its plains are
cultivated, its rivers navigable, its hills and valleys furrowed
by the plough, even to the very basement of any lingering ruin of
tower or steeple that may be scattered amongst them.&nbsp; How
much more, therefore, may we expect to find a dearth of such
literature in the heart of the great city, where the struggles
<!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>of working-day life among looms and factories, leave
little time or room for aught else than the stern
<i>realities</i> of existence to be known or felt?</p>
<p>But every where there exist some fragments of superstition,
poetical or uncouth; and we may not feel surprise that among such
a people as the lower orders of society, in an East Anglian
manufacturing city, they should bear little trace of the
refinement which beautiful and romantic scenery and occupation
are wont in other scenes to throw over them.&nbsp; Rarely do we
hear of a haunted house, or a walking ghost; but not unseldom do
we see the horse-shoe nailed over the door-way of the cottage, as
an antidote to the power of witchcraft,&mdash;nor is it uncommon
to hear among the poor, of charms to cure diseases, of
divinations by <i>wise men</i> and <i>wise women</i>, who by
mystic rites pretend to discover lost or stolen
property,&mdash;nor even of animals bewitched, exercising direful
influence over the lives and health of human beings.&nbsp; Within
the limits of this age of enlightenment and civilization, many
are the recorded facts of this nature, and many more of continual
recurrence might be added, in illustration of the truth, that the
lowest and grossest forms of vulgar superstition yet lurk about
in the purlieus and by-ways of the old city.</p>
<p>Not long since, a woman, holding quite a respectable rank
among the working classes, and in her way a perfect
&ldquo;<i>character</i>&rdquo; avowed herself determined <!--
page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;to <i>drown&rsquo;d</i> the cat,&rdquo; as soon
as ever her baby, which was lying ill, should die; for which
determination the only explanation she could offer was, that the
cat jumped upon the nurse&rsquo;s lap, as the baby lay there,
soon after it was born, from which time it ailed, and ever since
that time, the cat had regularly gone under its bed once a day
and coughed twice.&nbsp; These mysterious actions of poor
&ldquo;Tabby,&rdquo; were assigned as the cause of the baby
wasting, and its fate was to be sealed as soon as that of the
poor infant was decided.&nbsp; That the baby happened to be the
twenty-fourth child of his mother, who had succeeded in rearing
four only of the two dozen, was a fact that seemed to possess no
weight whatever in her estimation.&nbsp; The same strong-minded
individual, for in many respects she <i>is</i> wonderfully
strong-minded, scruples not to avow greater faith in the magical
properties of red wool, tied round a finger or an arm, in curing
certain ailments of the frame, than in many a remedy prescribed
by &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s&rdquo; skill; nor has the theoretical
belief been altogether unsupported by practice; on more than one
occasion, she will aver, her own life has thus been saved.</p>
<p>As for divinations and charms, to doubt their faith in them
would be to discredit the evidence of our senses.&nbsp; A poor
washerwoman, but a few years since, who possessed more honesty
than wisdom, happened to lose some linen belonging to one of her
employers.&nbsp; <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span><i>Suspecting</i> it to have been
stolen, she repaired to a <i>wise man</i>, who, of course,
succeeded in convincing her, upon the payment of half-a-crown,
that her surmise was correct; but as it helped her no further
towards its recovery, it only added to the expense her honesty
prompted her to go to, to replace it, which she secretly
contrived to do, and offered it to her employer, with a statement
of the facts.</p>
<p>These are but faint specimens of the &ldquo;vulgar
errors&rdquo; that are every day to be met with among the
citizens, oftentimes attested more by deeds than words; for many
will in secret consult the <i>wise</i> people, and pay them well,
who would still shrink from openly acknowledging faith in their
revelations or predictions.</p>
<p>Though haunted houses are rare, there still are some known to
exist;&mdash;one respectable, elderly maiden, yet amongst us, has
veritable tales of refractory spirits, that took twelve clergymen
to read them down, and of one who haunted some particular closet,
where at last he submitted to priestly authority, a cable and a
hook being firmly fixed in the floor of the closet to bind
him.&nbsp; We rather fancy some of the other legends that we have
heard from the same authority, are but variations of the story of
Heard&rsquo;s spirit, that haunted the Alder Carr Fen Broad,
which assumed the appearance of a Jack-o&rsquo;-Lantern, and
refused to be &ldquo;laid!&rdquo; the gentlemen who attempted it
failing, because he always kept a verse <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>ahead of
them, until a boy brought a couple of pigeons, and laid down
before the Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, who, looking at them, lost his
verse, and then they succeeded in binding his spirit.</p>
<p><i>This</i>, and many other tales, have been collected by the
rector of the parish of Irstead, from an old woman living there;
and they contain so much that is amusing, that we cannot forbear
repeating them for the benefit of those who have not had the
opportunity of seeing the papers of the Arch&aelig;ological
Society.&nbsp; Mrs. Lubbock is an old washerwoman, who, left a
widow with several children, has maintained herself
&ldquo;independently&rdquo; up to her eightieth year, without
applying even for out-door parish relief, until the cold winter
of 1846 made her, as she expresses it, <i>sick</i> for crumbs
like the birds.&nbsp; Education she has had none, that is, of
book learning, but she seems to have had a father, given to
anecdote, from whom she professes to have heard most of the
&ldquo;saws&rdquo; and tales of which she has such a
profusion.&nbsp; She mentions the practice, among her
acquaintance, of watching the church porch on St. Mark&rsquo;s
eve, when, at midnight, the watcher may see all his acquaintance
enter the church: those who were to die remained, those who were
to marry went in couples and came out again.&nbsp; This, one
Staff had seen; but he would not tell the names of those who were
to die or be married.</p>
<p><!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>On Christmas-eve, she says, at midnight the cows and
cattle rise and turn to the east; and the horses in the stable,
as far as their halters permit.&nbsp; She says that a farmer once
observing the reverent demeanour of the horse, who will leisurely
stay some time upon his knees moving his head about and blowing
over the manger, remarked, &ldquo;Ah, they have more wit than
we;&rdquo; which brings to mind an anecdote, related by an ear
witness, of a controversy that took place in this city among some
cattle-drovers, when an Irishman and Roman Catholic supported the
claims of his religion by commenting upon the invariable practice
amongst those of his own class, of saying their prayers before
retiring to rest; whereas, added he, &ldquo;among you Protestants
the <i>horse</i> is the only real Christian that I ever met with,
who kneels before he goes to sleep and when he gets
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; That there is too much ground for the satire no
one can doubt.</p>
<p>The Rosemary is said to flower on old Christmas-day, and Mrs.
Lubbock says that she recollects, on one occasion, a great
argument about which was the real Christmas-day, and to settle
the point three men agreed to decide by watching that
plant.&nbsp; They gathered a bunch at eleven o&rsquo;clock at
night of the old Christmas-day; it was then in bud.&nbsp; They
threw it upon the table, and did not look at it until after
midnight, when they went in, and found the bloom just dropping
off.</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>Concerning the weather, she says, when a sundog (or two
black spots to be seen by the naked eye) comes on the south side
of the sun, there will be fair weather; when on the north, there
will be foul.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sun then fares to be right muddled
and crammed down by the dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the moon, she says&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Saturdays new and Sundays full<br />
Never was good, and never <i>wull</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see the old moon with the new, there will be
stormy weather.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;If it rains on a Sunday before mass,<br
/>
It rains all the week, more or less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it rains on a Sunday before the church doors are
open, it will rain all the week, more or less; or else we shall
have three rainy Sundays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it rains the first Thursday after the moon comes in,
it will rain, more or less, all the while the moon lasts,
especially on Thursdays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there be bad weather, and the sun does not shine all
the week, it will always show forth some time on the
Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be a hard winter when acorns abound, and
there are no hips nor haws:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;If <i>Noah&rsquo;s Ark shows</i> many
days together,<br />
There will be foul weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On three nights in the year it never lightens
(<i>i.e.</i> clears up) anywhere; and if a man knew those nights,
he would not turn a dog out.</p>
<p><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;We shall have a severe winter when the swallows
and martins take great pains to teach their young ones to fly;

then she was comfortable, and did not think of any other

the lightning, because the turf burnt so

<p>&ldquo;He is always here three months to a day, and sings all

<p>With reference to howling dogs, she says, &ldquo;Pull off your

howl.&nbsp; There was no tax then, <!-- page 292--><a

<p>Among the historical prophecies of Mother Shipton and Mother
Bunch, her sister, as remembered by her, are&mdash;</p>
<p>That Mrs. Shipton foretold that the time should come when
ships should go without sails, and carriages without horses, and
the sun should shine upon hills that never <i>see</i> the sun
before; all which are fulfilled, Mrs. Lubbock thinks, by
steamers, railways, and cuttings through hills, which let in upon
them the light of the sun.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shipton also foretold that we should know the summer from
the winter only by the green leaves, it should be so cold.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That the Roman Catholics shall have this country again,
and make England a nice place once more.&nbsp; But as for these
folks, they scarce know how to build a church, nor yet a
steeple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That England shall be won and lost three times in one
day; and that, principally, through an embargo to be laid upon
vessels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there is to come a man who shall have three thumbs
on one hand, who is to hold the king&rsquo;s horse in battle; he
is to be born in London, and be a miller by business.&nbsp; The
battle is to be fought at Rackheath-stone <!-- page 293--><a

the Norwich road.&nbsp; Ravens shall carry the blood away, it
will be so clotted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the men are to be killed, so that one man shall be
left to seven women; and the daughters shall come home, and say
to their mothers, &ldquo;Lawk, mother, I have seen a
man!&rdquo;&nbsp; The women shall have to finish the harvest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the town of Yarmouth shall become a nettle-bush;
that the bridges shall be pulled up, and small vessels sail to
Irstead and Barton Broads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That blessed are they that live near Potter Heigham,
and double-blessed them that live in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (That
parish seems destined to be the scene of some great and glorious
events.)&nbsp; May the blessing prove true!</p>
<p>We here close our extracts from Mrs. Lubbock&rsquo;s Norfolk
sayings, and now go back to superstitions of earlier date, that
are so connected with Kett&rsquo;s rebellion as to make them
peculiarly interesting as matters of history.&nbsp; During the
wars of the Roses, predictions of wars and rebellions, not
unfrequently proclaiming hostility towards the privileged
classes, were very common.&nbsp; Both persons and places were
often designated by strange hieroglyphical symbols, frequently
taken from heraldic badges and bearings, or analogies extremely
puzzling to explain.&nbsp; They are alluded to in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Henry the Fourth,&rdquo; among the
incitements that urged Hotspur to anger, and Owen Glendower to
rebellion, and recorded by <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>Hall, who
says in his Chrouicle, &ldquo;that a certain writer writeth that
the Earl of March, the Lord Percy, and Owen Glendower, were made
believe, by a Welsh prophecier, that King Henry was the
<i>moldewarpe</i> (mole) <i>cursed of God&rsquo;s own mouth</i>,
and that they three were the dragon, the lion, and the wolf which
should divide the realm between them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prophecy
was doubtless identical with that published in 1652, under the
title of &ldquo;Strange Prophecies of Merlin,&rdquo; where it is
said, &ldquo;Then shall the proudest prince in all Christendom go
through Shropham Dale to Lopham Ward, where the White Lion shall
meet with him, and fight in a field under Ives Minster, at South
Lopham, where the prince aforesaid shall be slain under the
minster wall, <i>to the great grief of the priests all</i>; then
there shall come out of Denmark a Duke, and he shall bring with
him the King of Denmark and sixteen great lords in his company,
by whose consent he shall be crowned king in a town of
Northumberland, and he shall reign three months and odd
days.&nbsp; They shall land at <i>Waborne Stone</i>; they shall
be met by the Red Deere, the Heath Cock, the Hound, and the
Harrow: between <i>Waborne</i> and <i>Branksbrim</i>, a forest
and a church gate, there shall be fought so mortal a battle, that
from Branksbrim to Cromer Bridge it shall run blood; then shall
the King of Denmark be slain, and all the perilous fishes in his
company.&nbsp; Then shall the duke come forth manfully to Clare
<!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>Hall, where the <i>bare</i> and the <i>headlesse
men</i> shall meet him and slay all his lords, and take him
prisoner, and send him to <i>Blanchflower</i>, and chase his men
to the sea, where twenty thousand of them shall be drowned
without dint of the sword.&nbsp; Then shall come in the French
king, and he shall land at Waborne Hope, eighteen miles from
Norwich: there he shall be let in by a false mayor, and that
shall he keep for his lodging for awhile; then at his return
shall he be met at a place called Redbanke, thirty miles from
Westchester, where at the first affray shall be slain nine
thousand Welchmen and the double number of enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These sort of predictions, often accompanied by symbolical
illustrations, continued to gain popularity, and were made use of
at various periods to serve the purposes of the people.&nbsp; Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essays on the Prophecies of Thomas
the Rhymer,&rdquo; shew the application made of them in the time
of the Stuarts.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII., they excited
so much alarm, as to cause an act to be passed, which declared,
&ldquo;that if any person should print, write, speak, sing, or
declare to any other person, of the king or any other person, any
such false prophecies upon occasion of any arms, fields, beasts,
fowls, or such like things, they shall be deemed guilty of
felony, without benefit of the clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confession of Richard Byshop, of Bungay, when <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>arraigned before the Privy Council a few years prior to
the date of the above act, shews upon what grounds the fear it
expresses was founded.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The
confession of Richard Byshop</span>, <span class="smcap">of
Bungay</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Memorandum: that the said Richard Byshop saith, that he
met with one Robert Seyman, at Tyndale Wood, the 11th day of May,
about nine of the clock, in the twenty-ninth year of the reign of
our sovereign lord King Henry the Eighth, and after such
salutation as they had then, the said Richard Byshop said to the
said Robert, &lsquo;What tythings hear you?&nbsp; Have you any
musters about you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And the said Robert said
&lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the said Richard said, &lsquo;This
is a hard world for poor men.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the said Robert
said, &lsquo;Truly it is so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the said Richard
said, &lsquo;Ye seem to be an honest man, and such a one as a man
may open his mind unto.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the said Robert said,
&lsquo;I am a plain man; ye may say to me what ye
woll.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the said Richard said, &lsquo;We are
so used now-a-days at Bungay as was never seen afore this; for if
two or three good fellows be walking together, the constables
come to them, and woll know what communication they have had, or
else they shall be stocked.&nbsp; And as I have heard lately at
Walsingham, the people had risen if one person had not
been.&nbsp; And as I hear say, some of them now be in Norwich
Castle, and others be sent to London.&rsquo;&nbsp; And further,
the said Richard said, <!-- page 297--><a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>&lsquo;If
two men were gathered together, one might say to another what he
would as long as the third man was not there; <i>and if three men
were together</i>, <i>if two of them were absent</i>, the third
might say what he would in surety enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
said he knew there was a certain prophecy, which if the said
Robert would come to Bungay, he should hear it read; and that one
man had taken pains to watch in the night to write the copy of
the same.&nbsp; And if so be, as the prophecy saith, there shall
be a rising of the people this year or never.&nbsp; And that the
prophecy saith the king&rsquo;s grace was signified by a mowle,
and that the mowle should be subduyt and put down.&nbsp; And that
the said Richard did hear that the Earl of Derby was up with
many; and that he should be proclaimed traitor in those parts
where he dwelleth.&nbsp; And also he heard, as he saith, that a
great company was fled out of the land.&nbsp; And that the Duke
of Norfolk&rsquo;s grace was in the north parts, and was so to be
set about, as he heard say, that he might not come away when he
would.&nbsp; I pray God that it be not so.&nbsp; Also he said
that the prophecy saith that three kings shall meet on Mousehold
Heath, and the proudest prince in Christendom be their
subject.&nbsp; And that the White Lion should stay all that
business at length, and should obtain.&nbsp; And said,
&lsquo;Farewell, my friend, and know me another day if ye can,
and God send us a quiet world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>The same prophecies here alluded to were revived and
repeated, together with many doggrel rhymes, at the time of the
famous Kett&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp; The historian of the event
says that they were rung in the ears of the people every hour,
such as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The county Gnoffes, Hob, Dick, and Hick,<br
/>
With clubbs and clowted shoon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall fill the vale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Duffin&rsquo;s dale<br />
With slaughtered bodies soon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The headless men within the dale,<br />
Shall there be slain both great and small.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So positively were these sort of prophecies applied to the
circumstances of the time, that the rebels who had possession of
a favourable position on the heights of the common, forsook it in
expectation of realizing the prediction by coming into the
valley, &ldquo;believing themselves,&rdquo; as the historian has
it, &ldquo;to be the <i>upholsterers</i> that were to make
Duffin&rsquo;s Dale a large soft pillow for death to rest on,
whereas they proved only the <i>stuffing to fill the
same</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The common phrase, &ldquo;A cock and bull story,&rdquo; took
its origin from these symbolical prophecies, in which the figures
of animals were so often introduced.</p>
<p>Among the records of other medi&aelig;val superstitions, <!--
page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>are many curious details of the &ldquo;invocation of
spirits&rdquo; to aid the searchers after &ldquo;Treasure
Trove,&rdquo; as it was called.&nbsp; In the days when
&ldquo;banking&rdquo; was unknown, wealth oftentimes accumulated
in the hands of its owners, to a degree that rendered its safe
keeping a perilous task; and in very early ages it would seem to
have been a common practice to commit it to the bosom of mother
earth, until such time as its owner might have need of it.&nbsp;
The changes wrought upon the land by the several conquests that
succeeded the departure of the Romans, the reputed depositors of
these hidden treasures, caused the ownership to be forgotten and
obscure, and by degrees all such property became the right of the
crown; and to conceal any discovery of it was made an act of
felony, at first punishable by death, but afterwards subjecting
the perpetrator only to a pecuniary fine.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that in the sixteenth century, it was
customary to grant licenses to individuals, to engage in the
search after these hidden stores of precious stones, metal, or
coins; also permission to invoke the aid of spirits in their
pursuit.&nbsp; Among many other quaint stories upon the subject,
two especially connected with the localities in this
neighbourhood claim attention here: the first is the confession
of William Stapleton, a monk in the abbey of St. Bennet in the
Holm, addressed to Cardinal <!-- page 300--><a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>Wolsey, and
many very curious illustrations it gives of the superstitious
feeling of the time; the other is that of Sir Edward Neville, who
was arraigned, tried, and executed for high treason, as an
accomplice of Cardinal Pole, in the thirtieth year of Henry the
Eighth.&nbsp; The extracts are taken from the papers of the
Norfolk Arch&aelig;ological Society.</p>
<p>Stapleton seems to have been an idle monk, often punished
&ldquo;for not rising to matins, and doing his duty in the
church, which led to his desire to purchase a
dispensation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being too poor to do so at once, he
obtained six months&rsquo; license to obtain the means, and set
about searching for &ldquo;Treasure Trove,&rdquo; by the help of
some books on Necromancy, which had been previously lent to
him.&nbsp; After some rambles about the county, he says, &ldquo;I
went to Norwich, and there remained by the space of a month, and
thence to a town called Felmingham, and one Godfrey and his boy
with me, which Godfrey had a &ldquo;<i>shower</i>,&rdquo; called
Anthony Fular, and his said boy did &ldquo;scry&rdquo; unto him
(which said spirit I had after myself); but notwithstanding as we
could find nothing, we departed to Norwich again, where we met
one unbeknown to us, and he brought us to a man&rsquo;s house in
Norwich, where he supposed we should have found treasure,
whereupon we called the spirit of the treasure to
appear&mdash;but he did not, for I suppose of a truth there was
none there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>Stapleton goes on to say that, failing in his efforts,
he borrowed money to buy his dispensation of &ldquo;his
Grace&rdquo; to be a hermit, and then went to the
&ldquo;diggings&rdquo; again.&nbsp; He was then informed that one
Leech had a book to which the parson of Lesingham had bound a
spirit, called Andrew Malchus; &ldquo;whereupon,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I went to Leech concerning the same, and upon our
communication he let me have all his instruments to the said
book, and shewed me that if I could get the book that the said
instruments were made by, he would bring me to him that should
speed my business shortly.&nbsp; And then he shewed me that the
parson of Lesingham and Sir John of Leiston, with other to me
unknown, had called up of late Andrew Malchus, Oberion, and
Inchubus.&nbsp; And when they were all raised, Oberion would not
speak.&nbsp; And the then parson of Lesingham did demand of
Andrew Malchus why it was.&nbsp; And Andrew Malchus made answer,
it was because he was bound to the Lord Cardinal.&nbsp; And they
did entreat the parson of Lesingham to let them depart at that
time, and whensoever it should please them to call them up again,
they would gladly do them any service they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I had all the said instruments, I went to
Norwich, where I had remained but a season, when there came to me
a glazier, which, as he said, came from the Lord Leonard
Marquess, for to search for one that was expert in such
business.&nbsp; And thereupon <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>one Richard
Tynny came and instanced me to go to Walsingham with him, where
we met with the said Lord Leonard, the which Lord Leonard had
communicated with me concerning the said art of digging, and
thereupon promised me that if I would take pains in the
exercising the same art, that he would sue out a dispensation for
me that I should be a secular priest, and so would make me his
chaplain.&nbsp; And, for a trial to know what I could do in the
same art, he caused his servant to go hide a certain money in the
garden, and I showed for the same.&nbsp; And one Jackson
&lsquo;scryed&rsquo; unto me, but we could not accomplish our
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John Shepe, Sir Robert Porter, and I, departed to a
place beside Creke Abbey, where we supposed treasure should be
found.&nbsp; And the said Sir John Shepe called the spirit of the
treasure, and I showed to him; but all came to no purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there came one Cook of Calkett Hall, and
showed me that there was much money about his place, and in
especial in the Bell Hill, and desired me to come thither; and
then I went to Richard Tynny, and showed him what the said Cook
had said, whereupon Tynny brought me to one William Rapkyn, took
me the book that the Duke&rsquo;s Grace of Norfolk of late took
away from me; which Rapkyn said to me that forasmuch as I had all
the instruments that were made for the said book, and if I could
get <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>Sir John of Leiston unto me, that
then we should soon speed our purpose, for the said Sir John of
Leiston was with the parson of Lesingham when the spirits
appeared to the said book; and so I went to Colkett Hall, and
took the said book and instruments with me; but he&rdquo; (Sir
John) &ldquo;came not; wherefore, when I had tarried three or
four days, I and the parish priest of Gorleston went about the
said business, but of truth we could bring nothing to
effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lengthened confession then goes into details of other
expeditions aided by Lord Leonard, which ended in his
imprisonment for deserting Lord Leonard, but he was afterwards
pardoned and set at liberty.&nbsp; He then goes on to say in his
letter, &ldquo;and whereas your noble Grace here of late was
informed of certain things by the Duke&rsquo;s Grace of Norfolk,
as touching to your Grace and him, I faithfully ascertain that
the truth thereof is as herein followeth, that is to say, one
Wright, servant to the said Duke, at a certain season showed me
that the Duke&rsquo;s Grace, his master, was sore vexed with a
spirit by the enchantment of your Grace; to the which I made
answer that his communication might be left, for it was too high
a subject to meddle with.&nbsp; Whereupon Wright went into the
Duke&rsquo;s presence and showed things to me unknown, which
caused the Duke&rsquo;s Grace to send for me; and at such time as
I was before his Grace I required his grace to show me what <!--
page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>his pleasure was, and he said I knew well myself, and I
answered &lsquo;Nay.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he demanded of Wright
whether he had showed me anything or nay, and he answered he
durst not, for because his Grace gave so strait commandment unto
the contrary.&nbsp; And so then was I directed to the said Wright
unto the next day, that he should show me the intention of the
Duke&rsquo;s Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wright seems then to have suggested to Stapleton that he
should pretend power to rid the Duke of the troublesome spirit;
and being strongly tempted by hopes of reward, he consented,
&ldquo;and feigned to him,&rdquo; when he sent for him again,
that he had forged an image of wax of his similitude, and
sanctified it&mdash;but whether it did any good for his sickness
he could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereupon the said Duke desired me that I should go
about to know whether the Lord Cardinal&rsquo;s Grace had a
spirit, and I showed him that I could not skill thereof.&nbsp;
And the Duke then said if I would take pains therein, he would
appoint me to a cunning man, Dr. Wilson.&nbsp; And so the said
Dr. Wilson was sent for, and they examined me, and the
Duke&rsquo;s Grace commanded me to write all these things, and so
I did.&nbsp; Whereupon, considering the great folly which hath
rested in me, I humbly beseech your Grace to be a good and
gracious lord unto me, and to take me to your mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>The case of Sir Edward Neville, quoted from the same
authority, commences by a statement of the treasonable words laid
to his charge, which were, &ldquo;The King is a beast, and worse
than a beast; and I trust knaves shall be put down, and lords
reign one day, and that the world will amend one
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was found guilty, hanged, drawn and
quartered.</p>
<p>He is suspected to have been connected with Stapleton the
monk, who has already appeared as a necromancer.&nbsp; At all
events, his confession shows again how much Wolsey was supposed
to be conversant with magic; and indeed the &lsquo;ring&rsquo; by
which the Cardinal was thought to have won the fatal favour of
the king, was noticed in the accusations against him when he
fell.</p>
<p>In seeking for treasure, Sir Edward fully acknowledges being
led to it by &ldquo;foolish fellows of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his account of his own dealings with spirits and magic,
there is much curious mixture of half-doubting marvel and self
deceit, probably not unconnected with influences baffling the
human intellect, so apparent in the kindred delusions of
Mesmerism, that strange development of the age of civilization,
in no respect differing from the superstitions usually considered
as the peculiar characteristics of the Middle ages.&nbsp; He was
also a practitioner of alchemy.&nbsp; He would jeopard his life
to make the philosopher&rsquo;s stone <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>if the king
pleased, aye, and was willing to be kept in prison till he had:
in a year he would make silver, and in a year and a half, gold,
which would be better to the king than a thousand men.&nbsp; But
Henry was too shrewd thus to be allured into mercy; and Neville
perished in the prolonged agonies which his sentence
involved.&nbsp; He appears, from other documents, to have been of
a light-hearted and merry temper; not very wise, but wholly
innocent of any crime, except a few idle words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came, he took me to a <i>littell</i> room, and
went to his garden, and there demanded of me many questions, and
among all others, asked if it were not possible to have a ring
made that should bring a man in favour with his Prince; seeing my
Lord Cardinal had such a ring, that whatsoever he asked of the
King&rsquo;s Grace, that he had; and Master Cromwell, when he and
I were servants in my Lord Cardinal&rsquo;s house, did haunt to
the company of one that was seen in your faculty; and shortly
after, no man so great with my Lord Cardinal as Master Cromwell
was; and I have spoke with all them that has any name in this

whether your saying be agreeable to theirs, or no.&nbsp; And I,
at the hearty desire of him, shewed him that I had read many
books, and specially the works of Solomon, and how his ring
should be made, and of what metal; and what virtues they have
after the canon of Solomon.&nbsp; And then he desired me
instantly to take the pains to make him one of them; and I told
him that I could make them, but I made never none of them, nor I
cannot tell that they have such virtues or no, but by hearing
say.&nbsp; Also he asked what other works had I read.&nbsp; And I
told him that I had read <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>the magical
works of Hermes, which many men doth prize; and thus departed at
that time.&nbsp; And one fortnight after, William Neville came to
Oxford, and said that he had one Wayd at home, at his house, that
did shew him more than I did shew him; for the said Wayd did shew
him that he should be a great lord, nigh to the partes that he
dwelt in.&nbsp; And in that lordship should be a fair castle; and
he could not imagine what it should be, except it were the castle
of Warwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I answered and said to him, that I dreamed that an
angel took him and me by the hands, and led us to a high tower,
and there delivered him a shield, with sundry arms, which I
cannot rehearse, and this is all I ever shewed him, save at his
desire, I went thither with him; and as concerning any other man,
save at the desire of Sir Gr. Done, Knt. I made the moulds that
ye have, to the intent he should have had Mistress
Elizabeth&rsquo;s gear.&nbsp; If any man or woman can say and
prove by me, otherwise than I have writed, except that I have, at
the desire of some of my friends, &lsquo;<i>cauled to
stone</i>,&rsquo; for things stolen, let me die for it.&nbsp; And
touching Master William Neville, all the country knows more of
his matters than I do, save that I wrote a foolish letter or two,
according to his foolish desire, to make pastime to laugh
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also concerning treasure trove, I was oft-times <!--
page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>desired unto it, by foolish fellows of the country, but
I never meddled with it at all; but to make the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone, I will jeopard my life, so to do it,
if it please the king&rsquo;s good grace to command me to do it,
or any other nobleman under the king&rsquo;s good grace; and, of
surety to do it, to be kept in prison till I have done it.&nbsp;
And I desire no longer space, but twelve months upon silver, and
twelve and a half upon gold, which is better to the king&rsquo;s
good grace than a thousand men; for it is better able to maintain
a thousand men for evermore, putting the king&rsquo;s good grace,
nor the realm, to no cost nor charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, concerning our sovereign lord the king&rsquo;s
going over, this I said, &lsquo;If I had been worthy to be his
grace&rsquo;s council, I would counsel his grace not to have gone
over at that time of year.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>One mode of consulting spirits was by the Beryl, by means of a
speculator or seer.&nbsp; Having repeated the necessary charms
and adjurations, with the invocation peculiar to the spirit or
angel he wished to call (for each had his peculiar form of
invocation), the seer looked into a crystal or beryl, to see his
answer, represented generally by some type or figure; sometimes,
though rarely, the angels were heard to speak articulately.</p>
<p>Different kinds of stone were also employed, and occasionally
a piece of coal.&nbsp; In Stapleton&rsquo;s confession, <!-- page
310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>he
mentions the <i>plate</i> he used being left in the possession of
Sir Thomas Moore.</p>
<p>Other records of similar proceedings, that have been extracted
from the archives of the Record-chamber, make frequent mention of
the magic crystals or stones.</p>
<p>The great names mixed up with the curious transactions
described in these two documents, give additional interest to
them as matters of history, and specimens of the enlightenment
prevalent among the very highest circles of society, in the
period that so immediately preceded the Elizabethan age.&nbsp; A
runaway monk, turning necromancer, was received into communion
with some of the noblest of the land; and an educated gentleman,
as Sir Edward Neville may be presumed to have been, hoped to win
favour by promises to discover the philosopher&rsquo;s stone.</p>
<p>Three centuries have passed, and the only traces that may be
found of these high-born credulities, lurk in the darkest corners
of the darkest alleys of poverty and ignorance.</p>

<p>The sketch of the Cathedral has embraced so much of the early
history of the various religious &ldquo;orders,&rdquo; as to
render but little necessary respecting the origin of the
&ldquo;fr&egrave;res,&rdquo; or friars, whose settlements, in the
city and neighbourhood, once occupied such important place in its
limits and history.</p>
<p>The Black Friars, or Preachers, White Friars, or Carmelites,
Grey Friars, or Minors, and the Austin Friars, all had at one
period, from the thirteenth century to the era of the
Reformation, large establishments within its precincts; besides
which, there was a nunnery, and divers hospitals, as they were
called, such as the Chapel of the Lady in the Fields,
Norman&rsquo;s Spital, and Hildebrand&rsquo;s Hospital; and
hermitages without number lurked about the corners <!-- page
312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>of
its churchyards, or perched themselves above the gateways of its
walls.&nbsp; The greater portion of these have left but a name,
or a few scattered fragments, behind to mark their site; but one
magnificent relic of the Black Friars monastery, comprising the
whole of the nave and chancel of their beautiful church, yet
stands in an almost perfect state of preservation,&mdash;a noble
witness of the wealth and taste of the poor
&ldquo;mendicant&rdquo; followers of Friar Dominick,&mdash;which
was rescued from destruction at the period of the general
&ldquo;dissolution,&rdquo; by the zeal and practical expediency
of municipal authorities.&nbsp; Of the two friaries that have
ceased to exist even in outline, it may suffice to record, that
the Carmelites numbered among them the eminent writer,
&ldquo;John Bale, the antiquary,&rdquo; as he is wont to be
called; the Austin Friars seem to have possessed few particular
claims for notice, save their less rigorous injunctions for
fasting, but the Friars Minors were the great rivals of the
Preachers, and both together, the sore troublers of the peace of
the &ldquo;Regulars,&rdquo; who looked upon the growing power of
this &ldquo;<i>secular</i>&rdquo; priesthood with a jealousy and
hatred to be conceived only by those who appreciate duly the
&ldquo;loaves and fishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a sample of the feeling
existing, the account of Matthew Paris, the monk of St. Albans,
may fairly be cited.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;The &lsquo;friars
preachers&rsquo; having obtained privileges from Pope Gregory IX.
and Innocent IV. being rejoiced <!-- page 313--><a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>and
magnified, they talked malapertly to the prelates of churches,
bishops and archdeacons, presiding in their synods; and where
many persons of note were assembled, showed openly the privileges
indulged to them, proudly requiring that the same may be recited,
and that they may be received with veneration by the churches;
and intruding themselves oft-times impertinently, they asked many
persons, even the religious, &lsquo;Are you
confessed?&rsquo;&nbsp; And if they were answered
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;By whom?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;By my
priest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what idiot is he?&nbsp; He never
learned divinity, never studied the devices, never learned to
resolve one question; they are blind leaders of the blind; come
to us, who know how to distinguish one leprosy from another, to
whom the secrets of God are manifest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many
therefore, especially nobles, despising their own priests,
confessed to these men, whereby the dignity of the ordinaries was
not a little debased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another says: &ldquo;Now they have created two new
fraternities, to which they have so generally received people of
both sexes, that scarce one of either remains, whose name is not
written in one of them, who, therefore, all assembling in their
churches, we cannot have our own parishioners, especially on
solemn days, to be present at divine service, &amp;c.; whence it
is come to pass that we, being deprived of the due tithes and
oblations, cannot live unless we should <!-- page 314--><a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>turn to
some manual labour.&nbsp; What else remaineth therefore? except
that we should demolish our churches, in which nothing else
remaineth for service or ornament but a bell and an old image,
covered with soot.&rsquo;&nbsp; But these preachers and minors,
who begun from cells and cottages, have erected royal houses and
palaces, supported on high pillars, and distinguished into
various offices, the expenses whereof ought to have been bestowed
upon the poor; these, while they have nothing, possess all
things; but we, who are said to have something, are
beggars.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! how many a poor curate of this
nineteenth century, upon &pound;30 a-year, might subscribe to a
like pitiful complaint.</p>
<p>Another accusation against these mendicant friars, in their
days of maturity, was that they used to steal children under
fourteen years of age, or receive them without the consent of
their friends, and refuse to restore them, embezzling or
conveying them away to &ldquo;other cloisters,&rdquo; where they
could not be found.&nbsp; A statute of Henry IV. subjected these
friars to punishment for this offence; and the provincials of the
four orders were sworn before the parliament, for themselves and
successors, to be obedient to this statute.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick, from whom the above is quoted, says elsewhere,
that in 1242, a great controversy arose between the friars minors
and preachers, about the <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>greatest
worthiness, most decent habit, the strictest, humblest, and
holiest life; for the preachers challenged pre-eminence in
these&mdash;the minors contradicted, and great scandal
arose.&nbsp; And because they were learned men, it was the more
dangerous to the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are they,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;who in sumptuous
edifices, and lofty walls, expose to view inestimable treasures,
impudently transgressing the limits of poverty, and the
fundamentals of their profession; who diligently apply themselves
to lords and rich persons, that they may gape after wealth;
extorting confessions and clandestine wills, commending
themselves and their order only, and extolling them above all
others.&nbsp; So that no Christian now believes he can be saved,
unless he be governed by the councils of the preachers and
minors.&nbsp; In obtaining privileges, they are solicitors; in
the courts of kings and potentates, they are councillors,
gentlemen of the chamber, treasurers, match-makers,
matrimony-brokers; executioners of papal extortions; in their
sermons, either flatterers or stinging backbiters, discoverers of
confession, or impudent rebukers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making all due allowance for the party feeling of the
historian, thus commemorating the factions of the &ldquo;Mother
Church,&rdquo; enough may be seen of the truth, to form a general
idea of the condition of the brotherhoods, one of whose
&ldquo;palaces, supported by high <!-- page 316--><a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>pillars,&rdquo; is now left us as a subject for our
investigation.</p>
<p>The order of Black Friars owe their origin to the famous
Dominick, notorious for his zeal in the persecution of the
Albigenses.&nbsp; He figures also in the &ldquo;Golden
Legend,&rdquo; as a miraculously endowed infant; his god-mother
perceiving on his forehead a star, which made the whole world
light.&nbsp; The common seal of the Black Friars, still
preserved, commemorates another miracle concerning him:
&ldquo;Being grown to man&rsquo;s estate, he became a great
preacher against heretics; and once upon a time, he put his
authorities against them in writing, and gave the schedule into
the hands of a heretic, that he might ponder over its
contents.&nbsp; The same night, a party being met at a fire, the
man produced the schedule, upon which he was persuaded to cast it
into the flames, to test its truth; which doing, the schedule
sprung back again, after a few minutes, unburnt; the experiment
was repeated thrice, with the same results; but the heretics
refused to be convinced, and pledged themselves not to reveal the
matter;&mdash;but one of them, it seems, afterwards did
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other marvellous tales are extant of holy St. Dominick,
but we hasten on to take a look at the church of his
followers.&nbsp; The present building bears date of the fifteenth
century, and would seem to have been materially enriched by the
famous Sir Thomas <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Erpingham, who takes such prominent
place in the city, and church walls, and gateways, his arms
figuring here in the stone-work between every two of the upper
story of windows.&nbsp; In its primitive condition the church
boasted of three chapels, one of them subterranean, three altars,
two lights, and an image of St. Peter of Malayn; the choir was
decorated with panel paintings, which found their way at the
Reformation to the parlour of some private dwelling-house close
by, whose walls they yet adorn.&nbsp; Two guilds were held there,
the guild of St. William and the Holy Rood.&nbsp; In 1538, when
the axes and hammers of King Henry were busy over the face of the
land, and bonfires of libraries were being made in the precincts
of every monastery, the house and church of the Black Friars was
saved.&nbsp; Deputations to his majesty from the corporation of
the city, successfully negotiated the transfer of the building to
its possession, on consideration of the sum of eighty-one pounds
being paid into the Royal Treasury.&nbsp; Mention is made in old
records of a handsome library belonging to this as well as the
Carmelite Monastery; their fate perhaps may be conjectured by
that of many others of the time.&nbsp; Bale mentions the fact of
a merchant buying the contents of two noble libraries for forty
shillings, to be used as waste paper, and ten years were occupied
in thus consuming them.&nbsp; The chancel of the church has
retained its character <!-- page 318--><a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>as a place
of worship almost unvaryingly until the present day, at one time
being leased to the Dutch, and in later times used as a chapel by
the inmates of the workhouse; occasionally, however, it has
served the purpose of a playhouse; as we find on record, injuries
sustained by the breaking down of partitions at the performance
of &ldquo;interludes&rdquo; in it upon Sundays, in the
thirty-eighth of Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s players
we also find similarly occupying the nave or hall in Edward the
Sixth&rsquo;s reign, during Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday before
Christmas.&nbsp; The cloisters and other portions of the
monastery were in the reign of Anne, upon the first establishment
of workhouses for the poor, appropriated to that purpose, the
groined roofings to this day forming the ceilings of pauper
kitchens and outhouses.&nbsp; The sole trace of ecclesiastical
furniture lingering in the nave is a stone altar in one corner,
much more noted as the place of gathering in after-times for the
brethren of the St. George&rsquo;s Guild than for any religious
associations in the minds of the people.&nbsp; A gallery, now
hidden by the gigantic orchestra built over it, savours also
strongly of the primitive dedication of the building, else it has
retained little more than its architectural beauties of outline
to testify its original consecration.&nbsp; And now to trace its
history, since, wrested from the mendicants, and deprived of its
rights as a cemetery for the wealthy and beneficent <!-- page
319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>dead, it first became the banquet chamber for municipal
feasts, its walls shone gorgeously with tapestry hangings, and
its tables groaned beneath the weight of luscious dainties.&nbsp;
The kitchens and monster chimneys, with their long rows of
spit-hooks and fire-places, that now stand gaping in silent
desolation at the empty larders and boiling-houses in
out-of-the-way corners of the premises, look like giant ghosts of
ancient civic gastronomy, lurking about in dark places, mocking
the shadowy forms of latter-day epicurism, that may be satisfied
with the achievements to be performed by modern
&ldquo;ranges,&rdquo; on ever so improved a scale.&nbsp; But the
glories of the St. George&rsquo;s feast are likewise departed
from it; the corn-merchants, to whom its limits were awhile
devoted, have built unto themselves an exchange; the assizes,
once held in it, have been transferred to the little castellated
encrustation that has grown out of one side of the real castle
mound, and reft of all regular employment, the Hall now stands at
the mercy of the city mayor, by him to be lent to whom he wills,
for any or every purpose his judgment may deem consistent with
propriety; hence the same walls echo one day the eloquent
pleadings of a league advocate, the next to the cries of the
distressed agriculturist; now to the advantages of temperance or
peace societies, and the musical streams of eloquence that an
Elihu Burritt can send forth, or <!-- page 320--><a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>witness the
fires of enthusiasm a Father Matthew can elicit.&nbsp; Another
week shall see it thronged with eager listeners to the reports of
missionary societies, Church, London, or Baptist; the next with
ready auditors to the claims of the Jews and the heathen calls
for Bibles; interspersed among them shall be lectures on every
branch of art and science, and every fashionable or unfashionable
doctrine under the sun that can find advocates, down to Mormonism
or Bloomerism itself.&nbsp; But prior to all in its claims upon
the services of the magnificent old structure stands
<i>music</i>&mdash;why else are its proportions hid by the
unsightly tiers of benches that, empty, make one long for magic
power to waft them all away, but which, once tenanted by their
legitimate occupants, banish every murmur from one&rsquo;s heart
and mind?</p>
<p>Thanks to the enterprise and spirit of the lovers of harmony,
this is not seldom; concerts for the rich and concerts for the
poor, for the hundreds and the &ldquo;millions,&rdquo; have risen
up to meet the calls of humanity for heart-culture by other
inspirations than may be got from alphabets and primers, or
intellectual disquisitions.&nbsp; And, triennially, arrive the
great epochs of the city&rsquo;s glory, when she asserts her
claims upon the world of music, to be classed high among the
nursing mother of genius, and foster-parents of art.&nbsp; Then
is the hour of triumph for the Black Friars&rsquo; solemn and
grand old nave, when <!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>its roofs and pillars tremble at the
thunders of the Messiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; and
resound to the electrifying crash, uttering
&ldquo;Wonderful;&rdquo; or when they echo the sweet melodies of
Haydn, Mozart, and Spohr; the refined harmonies of a
Mendellsohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo; the magic strains of
his &ldquo;Loreley,&rdquo; or reflect the wondrous landscape
painting of the mystic Beethoven.&nbsp; Nor was the day a small
one when its orchestra gave utterance to the outpourings of a
genius cradled and nurtured in its bosom, whose work is
acknowledged to be great and good, <i>albeit</i> &ldquo;a
prophet&rdquo; is not without honour save in his own
country.&nbsp; And all praise be given as due to the generous
help yielded to the son of the stranger as to the son of the
soil.&nbsp; The world may yet live to be grateful to the city
that in one year brought before it two such conceptions and
creations as &ldquo;Israel Restored&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so would we take our farewell
of the old &ldquo;Hall,&rdquo; while our eyes are yet dazzled
with the bright glitter of its thronged benches, galleries, and
aisles, and our ears and hearts vibrating to the mighty
&ldquo;concert of sweet sounds&rdquo; and peals of harmony poured
forth from the almost matchless orchestra and benches of
choristers, that lend their powers to complete the glories of the
great &ldquo;Festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The festival suggests thoughts on music, its history and
progress, and of the minds that have fostered <!-- page 322--><a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>and
directed its growth in this particular region, so successfully as
to have gained for the &ldquo;Old City&rdquo; its present high
position in the musical world.</p>
<p>Music and devotion have gone hand-in-hand from the era of the
earliest singing men and singing women of Israel, and the timbrel
of Miriam; the Jewish temple echoed the lofty strains of
&ldquo;David&rsquo;s harp&rdquo; and the songs of the
&ldquo;Chief Musician;&rdquo; from the pagan worship of the
Greeks sprung the Ambrosian chant, and the Christian Church has
been the birthplace and nursery of the grandest conceptions that
have flowed from the pen of inspired genius in every later
age.&nbsp; The <i>antiphonal</i> singing of the earliest choirs,
where a phrase of melody, after being sung by one portion of the
choristers, was echoed by others at certain distances, at a
higher or lower pitch, gave rise to the modern fugue.&nbsp; The
Pope from his throne lent his aid to improve the ecclesiastical
chant, and gave it his name.</p>
<p>The oratorio was the Ph&oelig;nix that arose from the ashes of
the &ldquo;mystery,&rdquo; the masses of Palestrina, Handel,
Haydn, and Mozart, and Hummel were responses to the calls of the
church.&nbsp; The Reformation made no effort to sever music from
the services of religion; Luther was an enthusiastic lover of
harmony, and himself a composer of psalmody.&nbsp; The
annihilations of the works of art, that banished painting <!--
page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>and defaced sculpture, could not blot out music from
the worship of the church.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jubilate&rdquo; outlived the persecution of bishops and
clergy, and the nasal whine of the Puritan conventicle was in
itself a recognition of the true power and place of that noblest
of nature&rsquo;s gifts and sciences.</p>
<p>The quiet &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; nominally banish it from their
form of worship; can any that have heard the flowing melodies
that clothe their exhortations and prayers, say that it is
so?&nbsp; Can any one that ever heard the voice of Elizabeth Fry
doubt that poetry and music are innate gifts, that, once
possessed, no human laws can sever from the utterances of a
devotional spirit?&nbsp; No marvel is it, therefore, that a
Cathedral city at all times is more or less the cradle of musical
genius, or that scarce a record of a great master-spirit of
harmony exists, but the office of &ldquo;Kapellmeister,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Organist,&rdquo; is attached to his name.</p>
<p>The Organ, that almost inseparable associate of ecclesiastical
music, seems to have been an instrument of great antiquity; that
one of the Constantines presented one to King Pepin in 757,
appears to be an established fact, and that during the tenth
century the use of the organ became general in Germany, Italy,
and England.&nbsp; In Mason&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay on Church
Music&rdquo; is a homely translation of some lines written by
Wolstan, a monk of that period, <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>descriptive
of the instrument then known under that name.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Twelve pair of bellows ranged in stately
row<br />
Are joined above, and fourteen more below;<br />
These the full force of seventy men require,<br />
Who ceaseless toil, and plenteously perspire:<br />
Each aiding each, till all the winds be prest<br />
In the close confines of the incumbent chest,<br />
On which four hundred pipes in order rise,<br />
To bellow forth the blast that chest supplies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is presumed that the seventy men did not continue to blow
throughout the performance on this monster engine, but laid in a
stock of wind, which was gradually expended as the organist
played; the keys were five or six inches broad, and must have
been played upon by blows of the fist; the compass did not then
exceed more than two octaves; half notes were not introduced
until the beginning of the twelfth century, stops, not until the
sixteenth; from which we may infer, that a real genuine organ,
deserving the name, could not have been manufactured many years
prior to the Reformation; but from the date of its first
introduction may be ascribed the first attempts at the invention
of harmony.</p>
<p>It is curious, however, in these days of penny concerts and
music for the million, to look back to that time when the only
probable entertainments of a secular character in which music
bore a part, were <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>such as could be furnished by the
<i>hautboys</i>, sackbuts, and <i>recorders</i> of half-a-dozen
&ldquo;waytes,&rdquo; as we find to have been the case in this
city in the sixteenth century, when permission was first granted
these performers to play comedies, interludes, plays and
tragedies.&nbsp; Will Kempe mentions these same <i>waytes</i>
with great praise, and their renown may be inferred from the fact
of their being solicited by Sir Francis Drake &ldquo;to accompany
him on his intended voyage&rdquo; in 1589, upon which occasion
the city provided them with new instruments, new cloaks, and a
waggon to convey their chattels.&nbsp; The inventory of musical
instruments in the possession of the city in 1622, forms a rather
striking contrast to a &ldquo;band&rdquo; of the nineteenth
century, consisting as it did of only four
&ldquo;sackbuts,&rdquo; four &ldquo;hautboys&rdquo; (one broken),
two tenor cornets, one tenor &ldquo;recorder,&rdquo; two counter
tenor &ldquo;recorders,&rdquo; five &ldquo;chaynes,&rdquo; and
five &ldquo;flagges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century, when the country was deluged with
civil war, and overrun with Royalist and Puritan soldiers, music
declined, and we read little concerning it, here or elsewhere,
until that age of strife and commotion had passed away.</p>
<p>In 1709, one of the city &ldquo;waytes&rdquo; advertised
himself as teacher of the violin and hautboy, and in 1734 there
appeared another advertisement of a concert to be given, tickets
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, country dancing to be given gratis after
the concert, doors to be open at <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>four
o&rsquo;clock, the performance to commence at six, &ldquo;<i>by
reason of the country dancing</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of the sixteenth century, the psalmody of the
Protestant Church was brought nearly to its present state, and
towards the end of that and commencement of the next century,
shone that constellation of English musicians, whose inimitable
madrigals are still the delight of every lover of vocal
harmony.&nbsp; A madrigal differs from a glee, inasmuch as each
of its parts should be sung by several voices; its name
originated in Italy, and was applied to compositions in four,
five, or six vocal parts, adapted to words of a tender character;
neither madrigal nor glee should be accompanied by
instruments.</p>
<p>In the Elizabethan age to sing in parts was an accomplishment
held to be indispensable in a well-educated lady or gentleman;
and at a social meeting, when the madrigal books were laid on the
table, every body was expected to take part in the harmony; any
person declining from inability, was regarded with contempt, as
rude and ill-bred.</p>
<p>The rapid improvement of music in all its branches during the
last century has been promoted mainly by the various societies,
clubs, and other associations that have sprung up in the
metropolis and many large cities, among which Norwich stands
prominently; these have formed a bond of union between
professional musicians and amateurs, mutually advantageous, <!--
page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>by establishing among them a combination of talent and
taste, that tends materially to cultivate the art to which they
are attached.&nbsp; Norwich has produced many great minds, that
have done much towards this work.&nbsp; In the last century the
musical world were astonished by the wonderful precocity of the
two young children, Hook and Crotch; the name of the former as
notorious perhaps as much through the literary fame of his son
Theodore, as for his own musical attainments.</p>
<p>It is said that young Hook was able to play pieces at four
years of age, and at six to perform a concerto at a concert, and
to have composed the music for an opera with thirty-six airs,
before he was eight years old.&nbsp; In the course of his life he
is said to have written two thousand four hundred songs, one
hundred and forty complete works or operas, one oratorio, and
many odes and anthems.&nbsp; He died in 1813, leaving two sons,
Dr. James Hook, the Dean of Worcester, who died 1828, and
Theodore Edward Hook, the author.</p>
<p>William Crotch, whose name has attained a wider celebrity, was
also a native of the city, the son of a carpenter.&nbsp; His
early displays of musical talent exceed in wonder even those of
his fellow-citizen and co-temporary, Hook; and many curious
anecdotes are related of its manifestation during his
infancy.&nbsp; His father seems to have been a self-taught
musician, <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>who without any scientific knowledge
had built himself an organ, upon which he had learned to play a
few common tunes, such as &ldquo;God save the King,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Let Ambition fire the mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; About Christmas
1776, his child William, then only a year and a half old, was
observed frequently to leave his food or play, to listen to his
father, and would even then touch the key note of the tunes he
wished to be played.&nbsp; Not long afterwards, a musical lady
came to try the organ, and after her visit he seems to have made
his first attempt to play a tune&mdash;her playing excited him to
a painful degree, his mother describing him as so peevish that
she could &ldquo;do nothing with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Music had
charms, however, to soothe his baby breast, and he consoled
himself by picking out the air of &ldquo;God save the
King,&rdquo; which in addition to being his father&rsquo;s most
frequent performance, had been also frequently sung as a lullaby
by his maternal nurse.&nbsp; At this time he was <i>two years and
three weeks old</i>, truly an infant prodigy!&nbsp; The report of
his precocity gained little credence, until accident confirmed
what had previously been deemed the exaggerations of parental
fondness.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s employer, passing the house at a time when
the elder Crotch was absent from work on the plea of
indisposition, heard the organ, and fancied that his workman was
idle instead of ill; to convince himself, he went in, and found
little Master William <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>performing, and his brother blowing
the bellows.&nbsp; The marvel spread, and attracted such crowds
of auditors, that from that time the hours of his performance
were obliged to be limited.&nbsp; As he grew older his musical
attainments rapidly increased, while at the same time he
discovered symptoms of a genius for drawing, almost equal to that
which he had already displayed for music.</p>
<p>When he was twelve years old he did the duty of organist at
several chapels in Cambridge, whence he removed to Oxford, with a
view to entering the church; but he afterwards resumed the
musical profession, and was appointed organist of Christ Church,
in 1790.&nbsp; In 1797, he became professor of music in that
university; and in 1799, obtained the degree of doctor of
music.&nbsp; On the establishment of the Royal Academy, in 1823,
he was nominated Principal of that institution, but retired from
the office before his death.&nbsp; Dr. Crotch&rsquo;s great work
is the oratorio of &ldquo;Palestine,&rdquo; the poetry of which
is the prize poem of Bishop Heber.&nbsp; He was also the author
of several anthems, and other pieces of sacred music.</p>
<p>His death occurred suddenly, at the dinner-table, on the 29th
of September, 1847, in the seventy-third year of his age, at the
residence of his son, the Rev. W. R. Crotch, Master of the
Grammar School at Taunton, where he had spent the later years of
his life.</p>
<p>There are two points worthy of notice connected <!-- page
330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>with the name and works of this great man.&nbsp; The
country has raised no monument in any of its cathedrals or
churches to his memory, and his greatest work,
&ldquo;Palestine,&rdquo; is an oratorio almost entirely
neglected.&nbsp; May it not be possible for the &ldquo;Old
City&rdquo; that gave him birth to set an example to the rest of
the musical world, by attention to these facts?</p>
<p>Most of the leading minds whose zeal and energy directed the
earlier movements of the various musical societies in this
district, are yet among the living, and the natural dictates of
refinement cause us to shrink from any attempts at their
biographies; it is, therefore, with the deference due to real
genius, which needs no praise, that we pass in silence over the
names of the most earnest promoters of the growth and cultivation
of music, especially as developed in the workings of the Festival
Committee, and its important adjunct, the Choral Society.&nbsp;
The names and fame of Sir George Smart and Mr. Edward Taylor,
professor of music at Gresham College, are already too much the
property of the world at large to be reckoned among those whose
privacy might be invaded by comment in these pages; but there are
many more, who with them, may from the centre of that magnificent
hall, and the midst of the greatest triumphs of music that have
ever been achieved by its almost unrivalled choruses and
orchestra, feel that &ldquo;for their monument we must look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>And now it might seem but just and right that among the
lions of the &ldquo;Old City&rdquo; we should find a place for
the manifold ecclesiastical structures still surviving the
downfall of &ldquo;superstition,&rdquo; and retaining their
legitimate right, as houses of worship.&nbsp; To do justice to
the antiquities or beauties that abound among them is a task
beyond our powers, or the limit of such a work as this; their
traceries, their curiously cut flint work, old carvings, rood
lofts, chambers of sanctuary within, and heaped-up grave-yards
without, verily burying the pathways of the streets, they line in
such close succession&mdash;their monuments and epitaphs, quaint,
grim, chaste, and uncouth; their steeples, spires, and towers,
round, square, buttressed and bare&mdash;their bells musical and
grand, cracked and jangling&mdash;their roofs slated, tiled,
leaded, patched, perfect, or crumbling&mdash;their names and
saintships a labyrinth of mystery in themselves&mdash;would it
not fill a volume alone to chronicle even their leading features,
to say nought of the changes they have undergone, the barter
among goods and chattels, the chopping and changing, and
massacres in the painted glass departments,&mdash;part of an
Abraham and his ass left in a St. Andrews, the other portions
transported to the windows of St. Stephens; of the ghostly
outlines left of old brasses torn up and melted down by Puritan
soldiers and coppersmiths&mdash;or the legends that hang about
their shrines and mutilated images?&nbsp; We dare <!-- page
332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>not venture upon the well-beaten track of
arch&aelig;ologians, topographers, and tourists; our glance must
be cursory and superficial, content to ascertain by its sweeping
survey that treasures of knowledge and stores of information
await the patient and diligent investigations of more learned and
scientific enquirers.</p>
<p>A visit to St. Stephens rewards the arch&aelig;ologist by a
sight of a few old stalls and a font of early date, while the
historian associates with it the memory of the celebrated Parker,
second Archbishop of Canterbury, who was a native of Norwich, and
some say of this parish, but at any rate was singing pupil of the
priest and clerk of this church.&nbsp; Parker&rsquo;s life
occupies an important position in history.&nbsp; The son of
&ldquo;a calenderer of stuffs,&rdquo; in this city, he was at a
very early age left fatherless, and dependent upon a
mother&rsquo;s guidance and direction for his education.&nbsp;
Her superintending care provided him with a variety of masters
for the several branches of learning&mdash;reading, writing,
singing, and grammar&mdash;each being acquired under a separate
teacher.&nbsp; He afterwards entered Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, whence he was invited to the magnificent foundation of
Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s (now Christ Church) College, Oxford, but
preferring to remain at Cambridge, he declined.&nbsp; In 1553, he
was made chaplain to Queen Anne Boleyn, and received from her a
special commission to superintend the education of her daughter
Elizabeth.&nbsp; <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>He was made chaplain to King Henry
VIII., after the death of Anne Boleyn, and continued the same
office in his successor&rsquo;s reign; added to which, he was
Rector of Stoke in Essex, Prebend of Ely Cathedral, and
successively Rector of Ashen in Essex, and Birlingham All Saints,
in Norfolk.&nbsp; He was chosen Master of Corpus Christi College
in 1544, and Vice-Chancellor of the University.&nbsp; Happening
to be in Norfolk during the celebrated &ldquo;Kett&rsquo;s
rebellion,&rdquo; he had the courage to go to the rebels&rsquo;
camp and preach to them out of the oak of Reformation, exhorting
them to moderation, temperance, and submission, which expedition,
as we have seen elsewhere, had well nigh terminated fatally.</p>
<p>In 1550&ndash;1, he was put in the commission for correcting
and punishing the new sect of Anabaptists, then sprung up.&nbsp;
In Mary&rsquo;s reign he was deprived of most of his dignities,
upon the plea of his being married, and retired into Norfolk
amongst his friends; but upon the succession of his old pupil,
Elizabeth, he was exalted to the dignity of Archbishop of
Canterbury.&nbsp; Her Majesty made several visits to his house at
Canterbury.&nbsp; His efforts to suppress the vague prophecies
that were continually being set up in the various dioceses, and
exciting the minds of the people, made him many enemies among the
Puritans, but he still enjoyed the favour of the Queen.&nbsp; He
died in 1576, leaving, amongst numerous <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>charitable
bequests, a legacy to be applied to keeping his parents&rsquo;
monument, in St. Clement&rsquo;s church-yard, in repair.</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft, the brightest star in the
constellation of churches that illumine the &ldquo;Old
City,&rdquo; has beauties and curiosities of almost every variety
and character to offer for investigation; but perhaps none so
loudly appeal to the senses of the citizens at large as the
eloquent &ldquo;changes&rdquo; rung upon its magnificent set of
bells, whenever occasion offers for a display of the fulness and
richness of their tone; and, possibly, their melody is never more
appreciated than when it comes forth in the softened echo of the
beautiful muffled peal.</p>
<p>Touching the presence of bells in the church, we have noticed
elsewhere that they were introduced among the incrustations of
Pagan worship that grew up around the early Christian forms, and
owed their origin to the superstition that the sound of metal
preserved the soul from the danger of evil spirits; but there are
other curious facts connected with their history.&nbsp; The Roman
Catholic baptised the bell, using holy water, incense and prayers
in the ceremony and according to the missal of Salisbury, there
were godfathers and godmothers, who gave them names.</p>
<p>A strange allegorical signification of bells after their
baptism was written by Durandus, the great <!-- page 335--><a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>Catholic
authority, for the mysterious services of the church.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The bell,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;denotes the
preacher&rsquo;s mouth, the hardness of the metal implies the
fortitude of his mind; the clapper striking both sides, his
tongue publishing both testaments, and that the preacher should
on one side correct the vice in himself, and on the other reprove
it in his hearers; the band that ties the clapper denotes the
moderation of the tongue; the wood on which the bell hangs
signifies the wood of the cross; the iron that ties it to the
wood denotes the charity of the preacher; the bell-rope denotes
the humility of the preacher&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.&nbsp; The description goes on yet further into detail;
but the analogies between the subjects and their allegorical
representations are so undiscernible, as to make it a somewhat
tedious task to follow it throughout.</p>
<p>But St. Peter&rsquo;s has manifold attractions beyond its
bells.&nbsp; It has brasses and effigies, and monuments of every
variety, commemorating the pious deeds of clergy and laity,
warriors and comedians.&nbsp; Its vestry has pictures and
tapestry and quaint alabaster carvings; little chapels jutting
out from the nave like transepts, perpetuate the memory of old
benefactors; and beneath its pavement lie the remains of the
great philosopher Sir Thomas Browne, whose words of rebuke to the
sepulchral ambition of the nameless tenants of monuments that
make no record of those <!-- page 336--><a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>that lie
beneath, involuntarily arise to the mind while contemplating the
spot chosen for his last resting place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had they
made so good a provision for their names as they have done for
their relics, they had not so grossly erred in the act of
perpetuation; but to subsist in bones, to be but pyramidically
extant, is a fallacy of duration.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again,
&ldquo;to live indeed is to be again ourselves, which being not
only our hope, but an evidence in noble believers; &rsquo;tis all
one to lie in St. Innocent&rsquo;s church-yard or the sands of
Egypt.&nbsp; Ready to be anything in the ecstacy of being ever,
as content with six foot as the moles of Adrianus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy philosophy, that could permit him calmly to contemplate
the vicissitudes to which his bones might be subjected, even to
the legitimate possibility of the sanctuary chosen for their
resting-place being actually invaded by the blows of the
workmen&rsquo;s pickaxe, as veritably did occur some few years
since, when the curious of the present generation were thus
accidentally afforded an opportunity of cultivating a personal
acquaintance with the anatomical outlines and phrenological
developments of one whose intellectual offspring had been
canonized, and enshrined among the household gods of the learned
and the great for more than a century.</p>
<p>The very slight sketches of eminent characters that are
suitable for so light and general a book as <!-- page 337--><a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>this, may
perhaps be legitimately introduced in the course of a tour among
the churches, their <i>parochial headships</i> affording the best
facilities for arrangement; but it seems almost sacrilege to hash
up into abridgements or synopses, biographies so fraught with
national and European interest, as are many of those whose
birth-place has been the Old City of Norwich, yet more is
impossible within the compass of the <i>Rambler&rsquo;s</i> pen;
and to adopt the alternative of omitting all mention of such
names, would be to blot out some of the brightest pages from the
annals of its history.</p>
<p>Among them, and perhaps the highest upon the pinnacle of fame,
is that of Sir James Edward Smith, the Linn&aelig;us of our
country, the concentration of whose &ldquo;life and
Correspondence&rdquo; into two bulky volumes, evinces wondrous
powers of discriminating selection, and condensation, in the
biographer who has undertaken the important and onerous
task.&nbsp; What, then, can be effected in the hasty notices of a
mere rambler&rsquo;s gleanings?&nbsp; Little more, if so much, as
a bare outline of the leading features in the life of this
brilliant ornament of our city and country, but enough, we trust,
to lead any who have not already acquired a more intimate
knowledge of his personal history, to feel earnest to repair the
omission.&nbsp; He was a native of the parish of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft; and of his education, it is worthy <!--
page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>of note, that he never left the parental roof to enter
either a public or private boarding-school: he is one of the many
favourable testimonies to the advantages of a strictly domestic
education, conducted by aid of the most efficient masters, under
the immediate superintendence of parental care.&nbsp; About the
age of eighteen, he devoted himself to the study of botany as a
science, and says himself, &ldquo;the only book he could then
procure was &lsquo;Berkenhout,&rsquo; Hudson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Flora&rsquo; having become extremely scarce.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He received &ldquo;Berkenhout&rdquo; on the 9th of January, 1778,
and on the 11th began to examine the <i>Ule curop&aelig;us</i>
(common furze), and then first comprehended the nature of
systematic arrangement, little aware that, at <i>that
instant</i>, the world was losing the great genius who was to be
to him so important a future guide, and whose vacant place in the
world of science he was destined so ably to fill.&nbsp;
Linn&aelig;us died that night, January 11th, 1778.</p>
<p>In 1780 Mr. Smith went to Edinburgh, and from thence to
London, with a view to study for the medical profession.&nbsp;
During his stay there, he became intimate with Sir Joseph Banks,
an eminent patron of natural science, through whom he heard that
the library and museum of Linn&aelig;us were for sale, and
immediately he entered into negotiations with Dr. Acrel, of
Upsal, concerning it, which ended in his becoming the purchaser
of the whole collection at <!-- page 339--><a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>the price
of nine hundred guineas.&nbsp; From London he went to Leyden, and
graduated as a physician at the university there.&nbsp; From
thence he proceeded on a tour, visiting most of the classical
spots and celebrated places in Italy and France, and upon his
return to London devoted himself almost exclusively to pursuits
connected with his favourite science, botany.&nbsp; By the
assistance of his personal friend, the Bishop of Carlisle, one
among the many great minds with whom he held constant communion,
he set about establishing the Linn&aelig;an Society.&nbsp; Its
first meeting was held in April, 1788, when an introductory
address, &ldquo;On the Rise and Progress of Natural
History,&rdquo; was read by Sir James, then Dr. Smith, which
paper formed the first article in the &ldquo;Transactions of the
Linn&aelig;an Society,&rdquo; a work which has since extended
itself to twenty quarto volumes.&nbsp; In 1792 Dr. Smith was
invited to give instructions in botany to the queen and
princesses at Frogmore; and in 1814, received the honour of
knighthood from the Prince Regent.</p>
<p>Ill health caused Sir James to return to his native county to
recruit his strength, and there he continued to pursue his
literary avocations in comparative privacy.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;English Botany&rdquo; is a work consisting of thirty-six
octavo volumes, and contains 2592 figures of British
plants.&nbsp; It is a curious and melancholy coincidence, that
the fourth volume of <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>his &ldquo;English Flora&rdquo;
reached him on the very last day he ever entered his library; and
he thus had the gratification of seeing the completion of a work
which, in his own estimation, was calculated, beyond all the
other labours of his pen, to establish his reputation as a
botanist, and confirm his erudition as an author.</p>
<p>St. Giles, the next in order of the saintships, in addition to
its architectural beauties, with which we pretend not to
&ldquo;meddle,&rdquo; presents a few legendary claims to our
notice.&nbsp; The effigy of St. Christopher, of a monstrous size,
with his staff sprouting by his side, was originally painted over
the north door, as the patron saint of children presented for
baptism, who generally were brought in at that door.&nbsp; In
most churches where a north door existed, this image or painting
of St. Christopher was wont to appear, depicted on as large a
scale as the wall would permit, in conformity with the legend
that he was a saint of noble and large stature.&nbsp; In the
aisle once stood a chapel, altar, and image of St. Catherine,
with a light burning before it, and against one of the pillars
stood a famous rood, called the Brown Rood.</p>
<p>St. Benedict, the patron of monks, has his monument in the
form of a little ancient church with a little tower, round at the
bottom and octagonal at the top, where three little jingling
bells give notice of the hours of prayer.</p>
<p>St. Swithin, that famous prophet of wet weather, <!-- page
341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>has his memorial, too, not far distant.&nbsp; More have
heard the old adage, &ldquo;If it rain on St. Swithin&rsquo;s
day, there will be rain more or less for forty succeeding
days,&rdquo; than may have cared to trace its origin, which seems
involved in some mystery.&nbsp; One authority tells us that St.
Swithin was Bishop of Winchester, to which rank he was raised by
Ethelwulf, the Dane; and when he died in 865, he was canonized by
the pope.&nbsp; He had expressed a desire to be buried in the
open church-yard, and not, as was usual with bishops, within the
walls of the church: his request was complied with; but upon his
being canonized, the monks took it into their heads that it was
disgraceful for a saint to lie in the open church-yard, and
resolved to remove his body into the choir, which was to be done
in solemn procession on the 15th of July.&nbsp; It rained,
however, so violently on that day, and for forty days succeeding,
as &ldquo;had hardly ever been seen,&rdquo; which made them set
aside their design as heretical and blasphemous; and instead,
they erected a chapel over his grave, at which many miracles are
said to have been wrought.</p>
<p>Another writer tells us that &ldquo;St. Swithin, a holy bishop
of Winchester, about the year 860, was called the weeping St.
Swithin, for that, about his feast, Pr&aelig;sepe and Aselli,
rainy constellations, arise <i>cosmically</i>, and commonly cause
rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The legend attached <!-- page 342--><a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>to its name
is perhaps almost the only particular attraction of this little
church.</p>
<p>The church of the holy St. Lawrence stands upon the spot of
ground that in ancient days, when Norwich was a fishing town, was
the quay or landing-place for all the herrings brought hither,
the tithe of which was so considerable when it belonged to the
bishops of the East Angles, that when Alfric, the bishop, granted
the key staithe, with the adjoining mansion, to Bury Abbey, about
1038, the abbey, upon building the church, had a last of herrings
reserved to it, to be paid them yearly.&nbsp; This last of
herrings was compounded for by the celerer of the convent, about
the time of Henry the Third, for a pension of forty shillings,
which was annually paid until the time of Henry the Seventh, and
then done away with, on account of the meanness of its
profits.</p>
<p>On the sides of the arch of the door in the west are two
carvings, one representing the martyrdom of St. Lawrence, the
other that of St. Edmund, who is seen in a rather mutilated
condition, (in more senses than one) his head lying at some
distance in a parcel of bushes, while the Danes are shooting
arrows into his body, alluding to that portion of the legend
which says that when they could not kill him with arrows, Hunguar
the Danish leader ordered them to smite off his head, and carry
and throw it among the <!-- page 343--><a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>thickest
thorns of the adjacent wood, which they did; but a wolf finding
it, instead of devouring it, kept it from all beasts and birds of
prey, till it was found by the Christians and buried with his
body, and that in a surprising manner.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century, three &ldquo;Sisters of
Charity,&rdquo; called the Sisters of St. Lawrence, dwelt in a
tenement by the churchyard.&nbsp; In 1593, the copes were turned
into pall cloths, and in 1643 the painted glass of the windows
was smashed, and other considerable damage done to the ornamental
fittings up of the building.</p>
<p>Near to the church is the well of St. Lawrence, the water of
which is now conveyed to a pump; bearing this inscription upon
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This water here caught<br />
In sort, as you see,<br />
From a spring is brought<br />
Three score foot and three.</p>
<p>Gybson hath it sought<br />
From St. Lawrence&rsquo;s well,<br />
And his charge this wrought<br />
Who <i>now</i> here doth dwell.</p>
<p>Thy ease was his cost, not small&mdash;<br />
Vouchsafed well of those<br />
Which thankful be, his work to see,<br />
And thereto be no foes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From St. Lawrence&rsquo;s belfry, the curfew is rung at eight
each evening.</p>
<p><!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>St. Gregory&rsquo;s contains an altar tomb, with a long
Latin inscription to the memory of Sir Francis Bacon, a judge in
the court of King&rsquo;s bench, in the time of Charles II.</p>
<p>On the communion table is an inscription to Francis Watson, a
pedlar, who painted and marbled all the pillars of the altar,
adorned it, and railed the front.</p>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s <i>Madder Market</i> owes its distinctive
name to the market formerly held on its north side, for the sale
of <i>madder</i>, an article used in dying.&nbsp; Margaret,
Duchess of Norfolk, the widow of Thomas Duke of Norfolk, beheaded
by the command of Queen Elizabeth, lies buried in the choir of
the church.</p>
<p>St. Andrews, the second church in point of architectural
beauty, stands upon the site of one founded prior to the
Conquest.&nbsp; Its eastern window bears traces of sad havoc
having gone on in the midst of the scriptural scenes it was
intended to depict.</p>
<p>At the east end of the two aisles are doors entering from the
porches, and over them verses.</p>
<p>Over the south aisle door&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This church was builded of Timber, Stone and
Bricks,<br />
In the year of our Lord XV hundred and six,<br />
And lately translated from extreme Idolatry<br />
A thousand five hundred and seven and forty.<br />
And in the first year of our noble King Edward<br />
The Gospel in parliament was mightily set forward.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks be to God.&nbsp; Anno Dom. 1547,
December.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>Over the north aisle door&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>As the good king Josiah, being tender of age,<br
/>
Purged the realm from all idolatry,<br />
Even so our noble Queen, and counsel sage,<br />
Set up the Gospel and banished Popery.<br />
At twenty-four years she began her reign,<br />
And about forty four did it maintain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glory be given to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were formerly brass effigies of John Gilbert and his
wife, with <i>seventeen</i> of their children.</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Hungate, or Hounds&rsquo; Gate, owes its
name to the fact of the hounds belonging to the bishop being
formerly kept close by.&nbsp; The old church was demolished in
1458, and the new one, commenced the same year, was finished in
1460, as appears by the date in a stone on the buttress of the
north door, where there is an old trunk of an oak, represented
without any leaves, to signify the decayed church; and from the
root springs a fresh branch with acorns on it, to denote the new
one raised where the old one stood.</p>
<p>St. Michael at Plea takes its name from the Archdeacon of
Norwich holding his pleas or courts in the parish; it has some
curious panel paintings of the Crucifixion, Resurrection, the
Lady of Pity, Judas, John and the Virgin, St. Margaret and the
Dragon, St. Benedict and St. Austin.</p>
<p>In the church of St. Simon and St. Jude, is a <!-- page
346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>curious monument of a knight in armour, with a number
of other figures grouped around the altar on which he lies.&nbsp;
In this parish is the bridge where the &ldquo;cucking
stool&rdquo; was wont to be kept, an instrument of punishment for
&ldquo;scolding and unquiet women,&rdquo; of as ancient origin as
the time of the Anglo Saxons; the offender was seated in a kind
of chair, fixed at the end of a plank, and then <i>ducked</i> in
the water; a cheating brewer or baker subjected himself to a
similar degradation.</p>
<p>St. George&rsquo;s Tombland, so called from the burial ground
upon which it stood, has also some curious monuments; near it is
a house, commonly called Sampson and Hercules Court, from two
figures that formerly supported the portico, but which now stand
in the court.&nbsp; The house was formerly owned by Sir John
Fastolf, afterwards by the Countess of Lincoln, and in the time
of Henry VII., by the Duchess of Suffolk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Martin&rsquo;s at the Plain&rdquo; stands close by
the scene of the memorable battle between the rebels under Kett,
where Lord Sheffield fell, and many other gentlemen and soldiers:
the conflict lasted from nine o&rsquo;clock on Lammas morning
until noon.&nbsp; The World&rsquo;s End lane leads hence to the
dwelling of Sir Thomas Erpingham, long since transformed from a
sumptuous mansion into the abode of poverty, its chambers
subdivided and parcelled out, defaced and <!-- page 347--><a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>disguised
by whitewash and plaster, and yet more by the accumulations of
dirt and decay; until it needs the microscopic vision of an
arch&aelig;ologist to trace even its outline, among such a mass
of confusion and rubbish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Helen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; which belonged to the monks,
is now cut up into three parts, the choir being turned into

same for poor men, while the intermediate portion is used for

&pound;10,000, might, we think, find some better arrangements
possible to be made.&nbsp; Kirkpatrick, the celebrated
antiquarian, lies buried here.&nbsp; Over the south entrance to

King Henry the Eight of noble Fame<br />
Bequeathed the City this commodious place,<br />
With lands and rents he did endow the same,<br />

<p>St. Giles&rsquo; Hospital, to which the church of St. Helen
has been united by the appropriation of its nave and chancel, is
a relic of great antiquity&mdash;a <!-- page 348--><a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>memorial of
the liberality of Bishop Suffield, who in 1249 founded it,
appointing four chaplains to celebrate service there for his
soul, and all poor and decrepit chaplains in the diocese,
endowing it with means to support the same number perpetually,
and to lodge thirteen poor people with one meal a day.&nbsp;
There were also appointed afterwards four sisters, above fifty
years of age, to take care of the clothing, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;
The master and chaplains were to eat, drink and sleep, in one
room, and daily, after grace at dinner before any one drank, the
bell was to ring and the chaplains to go into the choir and sing
<i>Miserere mei Deus</i>.&nbsp; There was also an <i>Archa
Domini</i>, or Lords&rsquo; Box, from which the poor that passed
by, were daily to be relieved as far as the funds
permitted.&nbsp; From Lady day to the Assumption, at a certain
hour the bell was to ring and a quantity of bread, &ldquo;enough
to repel hunger,&rdquo; to be given to the poor then present; and
&ldquo;because the house should be properly &lsquo;Domus
Dei,&rsquo; or the house of God, and of the Bishops of
Norwich,&rdquo; it was ordained that &ldquo;as often as any
bishop of the see should pass by, he should go in and give his
blessing to the sick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edward VI. dissolved the
Hospital and gave it to the city as a house for the poor.&nbsp; A
school was also established, which was afterwards transferred to
the Free School.&nbsp; The cloisters of the old hospital still
remain almost entire, and serve as walks for the pensioners.</p>

Saints, <i>St. Saviour</i>, St. Clements the Martyr, <i>St. Peter

Michael at Plea, at <i>Thorn</i>, and <i>Coslany</i>, St.
Ethelred, St. John&rsquo;s Sepulchre, and St. John&rsquo;s
Timberhill, St. George, and St. Augustine, fill up the register
of ecclesiastical edifices; each possesses some particular claim
to notice, down to the legend of the Lady in the Oak, that gave a
distinctive title to the church of St. Martin at Oak, where her
image once figured in an oak tree in the churchyard, and wrought
wondrous miracles, which caused so much adoration to be paid to
the graven image, that the purgers of idolatry in good young King
Edward&rsquo;s reign, found it needful to displace it from its
high position, and cut down the tree in which it stood.</p>
<p>Among the biographies associated with the various districts
over which these patron saints may be said to hold their reign,
are those of the eminent divine, Dr. Samuel Clarke, of the
seventeenth century; Kay, or Caius, the founder of Caius College,
Cambridge; Professors Hooker and Lindley, the great botanists;
William Taylor, Sayer, Sedgwick, Gurney, Opie, and Borrow, among
the literary celebrities of the age; Professor Taylor and Dr.
Bexfield, names known well in the musical world, and many others,
whose lives and works entitle them to be ranked among the leading
characters <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>of their time; while in the medical
profession, the names and fame of Martineau and Crosse have
become European.&nbsp; Few of these can we pause to
sketch&mdash;many of them are among the number of those whose
work is not yet done; and of others it may be said that their
memory is too fresh in the hearts of those bound to them by
chords of affection and friendship, for a &ldquo;stranger to
intermeddle&rdquo; therewith.</p>
<p>William Taylor was the friend and correspondent of
Southey.&nbsp; It is said, in his &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; that he
once jocosely remarked, &ldquo;If ever I write my own life, I
shall commence it in the following grandiloquent manner;
&lsquo;Like Plato, like Sir Isaac Newton, like Frederick Leopold,
Count Stolberg, I was born on the 7th of November, and, like Mrs.
Opie and Sir James Edward Smith, I was baptized by the Rev.
Samuel Bourn, then the Presbyterian minister of the Octagon
chapel.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; His attainments as a German scholar
were notorious, and his metaphysical writings earned for him a
widely-extended fame.&nbsp; His translations of German
theological works, may be regarded as the first introduction of
that school of literature, that is at this moment deluging our
country with the copious streams of philosophy, whose deep and
subtle waters, whether invigorating or noxious, are spreading
themselves through every channel of society in our land.</p>
<p><!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>William Jackson Hooker, the son of a manufacturer of
Norwich, rose to the rank of Regius Professor of Botany, in the
University of Glasgow.&nbsp; In early life he was spoken of by
Sir James Smith as the first cryptogamic botanist of the time,
and his after-works proved the accuracy of the opinion.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Muscologia Brittannica,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Monograph on the
Genus Jungermannia,&rdquo; are unrivalled as guides to the
scientific enquirer, and, with his other works, may be classed
among the gems of English literature.&nbsp; In the course of his
rambles in the neighbourhood of his native city, he discovered,
in a fir-wood near Sprowston, that quaint, curious, one-sided
looking little moss, called <i>Buxbaumia aphylla</i>, which,
destitute of any visible foliage, rears its little club-like
seed-vessels upon its foot-stalks in the most eccentric possible
manner.&nbsp; The muscologist may search long and often ere a
specimen may meet his eye, even within the precincts of the grove
where Dr. Hooker first discovered it; but many another rare and
beautiful contribution to a moss herbarium shall reward him for
his pains, especially the elegant <i>Bartramia</i>, with its
exquisitely soft velvet foliage, and globular seed-vessels, to be
met with in such rich abundance in few other soils.</p>
<p>Lindley, the Professor of Botany in the London University, is
another genius raised from the nursery grounds of the Old City;
his father having followed <!-- page 352--><a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>the
profession of horticulture at Catton, one of the suburbs of
Norwich.</p>
<p>One more biographical notice must close our list, and with it
we make an end of our chronicles and &ldquo;Rambles in an Old
City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To those who were among the privileged number of friends,
acquaintances, or even fellow-citizens of Joseph John Gurney, it
will be easy to imagine why so beautiful a subject has been
chosen for the closing sketch of our &ldquo;pencillings by the
way;&rdquo; and the world at large will see in the name of the
great philanthropist, whose memory sheds a sacred halo over every
spot familiar with the deeds of gentle loving-kindness, tender
mercy, and active benevolence, that marked his earthly
career&mdash;a meet theme from which to borrow a ray of glory to
brighten the scene of our &ldquo;Ramblings,&rdquo; as the
landscape borrows a golden tint from the lingering beams of the
sun that has set beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>As the brother of Elizabeth Fry, her fellow-worker in the
field of usefulness, and her companion in her memorable visits to
the prisons of England, Ireland, Scotland, and the Continent, his
history could not have failed to possess a deep interest, even
apart from the individual characteristics of his bright and
beautiful home-life, and the lustre shed upon his name by its
familiar association with those of Clarkson, Wilberforce, and
Buxton, in the cause of slave emancipation.</p>
<p><!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>The third son of John and Catherine Gurney, and sister
of Priscilla Wakefield, he was born at Earlham Hall, August 2d,
1788.&nbsp; It is a singular fact connected with the name, that
one of his ancestors, in 1653, was sent a prisoner to the Norwich
gaol, for refusing to take the oath, and that Waller Bacon, of
Earlham, who committed him, resided at the time in the very Hall
which the descendants of the prisoner afterwards occupied.&nbsp;
When Joseph was only four years of age, the family of eleven
children lost the superintending care of their mother, and his
home education mainly devolved upon his three elder sisters,
among whom was Mrs. Fry.&nbsp; Their home was the scene of rich
hospitality, dealt out by their liberal-minded father; and the
literary tastes, intellectual pursuits, and elegant
accomplishments, in which every member of the social group
delighted, drew around them a brilliant circle of the choicest
society, to which the late Duke of Gloucester was a frequent and
welcome addition.</p>
<p>The scholastic instruction of Joseph John was at first
superintended by a clergyman, and afterwards matured at Oxford,
where he attended the professor&rsquo;s lectures, and enjoyed
many of the advantages of the university, without becoming a
member or subscribing to the thirty-nine articles.</p>
<p>Such an education naturally tended to create some doubts as to
the system of Quakerism; but after much <!-- page 354--><a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>examination
and consideration, his preference became settled in favour of the
views and profession of his old &ldquo;Friends;&rdquo; and
consistently with them he lived and died, by no means finding in
them any barrier to the fullest and freest association with any
other body of Christians, or to a personal friendship with the
ecclesiastical bishops of the diocese, with one of whom, Bishop
Bathurst, he was a frequent and esteemed guest; while to Bishop
Stanley was left the melancholy opportunity of bearing a
testimony to his public and private character, in the memorable
form of a funeral sermon from the cathedral pulpit, a tribute of
respect unexampled since the days of George Fox.&nbsp; His life
spent in doing good, in preaching as the minister of the society
to which he belonged, in England, Ireland, upon the Continent,
and in America, was full of interest.&nbsp; In the legislative
hall, at Washington, before the assembled members of Congress,
his voice was heard.&nbsp; Louis Philippe, Guizot, and De Stael,
were among his auditors in France; the King of Holland abandoned,
through his counsel, the importation of slave soldiers from the
Gold Coast; Vinet at Lausanne, D&rsquo;Aubigne in Geneva, and the
King of Wirtemberg, held council with him.&nbsp; To attempt to
chronicle his deeds of pecuniary munificence, public and private,
would be an herculean task.&nbsp; The great sums lavished upon
public societies, the world of necessity was made acquainted <!--
page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>with, but they formed but a moiety of the aids
furnished from his abundance to the wants of the needy.&nbsp; He
was truly one whose left hand was not suffered to know the deeds
of its fellow.&nbsp; The sick and the poor, at home and abroad,
the industrious and the struggling, the aged and the
young&mdash;each and all shared his bounty and loving help, for
he was one who <i>gave</i>, and did not <i>fling</i> his
charities down from the proud heights of opulence, so that
poverty might blush to pick them up.&nbsp; But the record of his
life was inscribed upon the page of history in characters
indelible by the tears that watered his pathway to the
tomb.&nbsp; We have made a faint effort to paint the last solemn
scene that marked the close of the lamented Bishop
Stanley&rsquo;s career, and were almost tempted to place side by
side with it the shade of grief that hung over the city when the
great &ldquo;<i>Friend</i>&rdquo; was suddenly called home from
his labours of usefulness and love upon earth.&nbsp; Few will
ever be able to forget the scene of mourning and sorrow that
followed the unlooked-for event, or the almost unparalleled
silence of woe that was written upon every heart and countenance
among the thronging thousands that attended to pay the last
tributes of respect at the grave of the beloved and honoured
philanthropist; when Magistrates and Artizans, Clergymen and
Dissenting Ministers, Churchmen, Independents, Baptists,
Methodists, and Friends, representatives of every grade of
society and shade of religious opinion <!-- page 356--><a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>that the
Old City could send forth, gathered around that lowly spot of
earth to drop a tear, and seek inspiration from the spirit of
love that seemed to breathe around the silent tomb.&nbsp; And who
will forget the thrilling prayer offered up from the lips of the
widowed mourner, who fulfilled, in the midst of that
heart-stricken multitude, her measure of obedience to the will of
Heaven and the duty of self-government, by public prayer and
thanksgiving.&nbsp; Who does not rank among the noblest of the
many noble sermons of the good Bishop Stanley, the far-sounding
appeal that was sent forth from the pulpit of his cathedral,
&ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;&mdash;the
commemorating words that have been inseparably linked with the
name and memory of Joseph John Gurney from that hour.</p>
<p>Years have passed since these events occurred, but the
remembrance of them is vivid; the rich legacy bequeathed to the
Old City by the holy life, walk, and conversation of such a man
is not soon expended; but treasured in the sanctuary of many
loving hearts, it is nurtured, and brings forth fruit, fifty,
seventy, and a hundred-fold, to the honour and glory of God, and
to immortalize the memory of a faithful servant in the vineyard
of souls.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
